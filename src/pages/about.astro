    About Compass
  </h1>

  <div class="space-y-6 text-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
    <p>
      Compass is a free, long-form political education project for South
      Africa. Its goal is simple: make the country's governance system legible
      to ordinary citizens — especially the "missing middle" who are educated,
      engaged, but never taught how the system actually works.

      Editorial principles
    </h2>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
      <li>
        <strong class="text-text-primary">Non-partisan:</strong> Compass explains
        systems, not parties. We don't tell you who to vote for — we help you
        understand what you're voting for.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong class="text-text-primary">Evidence-based:</strong> Every claim is
        backed by publicly available data — from the Auditor-General, National
        Treasury, Statistics South Africa, and other official sources.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong class="text-text-primary">Accessible:</strong> Written for smart
        people who aren't specialists. No jargon without explanation, no
        assumptions about prior knowledge.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong class="text-text-primary">Free:</strong> All content is free and
        always will be. No paywall, no premium tier, no ads.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="font-heading text-xl font-bold text-text-primary pt-4">
      Methodology
    </h2>

    <p>
      Each article follows a consistent methodology: start with the
      constitutional framework, layer on the legislative detail, connect to
      real-world examples using official data, and end with practical
      takeaways for citizens.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sources are cited throughout and collected in our
      <a

        Data Sources
      </a> page. We use official government publications, audited financial
      data, and academic research — never unnamed sources or speculation.
