## The Single Most Underleveraged Tool You Have as a Citizen

If you want to understand why a pothole stays unfixed for three years, why your clinic runs out of chronic medication in the second week of every month, or why your child's school has 55 learners in a classroom designed for 35, the answer almost always traces back to money. Not money in the abstract — not "the economy" or "government corruption" as vague complaints — but specific money, moving through a specific pipeline, collected by a specific institution, allocated through a specific Act of Parliament, transferred to a specific sphere, and either spent, misspent, or not spent at all by a specific department with a specific accounting officer whose name you can look up.

South Africa's intergovernmental fiscal system — the pipeline through which your tax money moves from your payslip to the services you receive — is the single most powerful tool you have for holding government accountable. It is also the tool that almost nobody teaches you how to use. In *The Architecture of the State*, you learned how the Constitution divides power across three spheres. In *Who Does What*, you mapped which departments deliver which services. In *How the Spheres Interact*, you saw the coordination machinery that connects the spheres. This article completes the picture by following the money: from the moment the South African Revenue Service collects it, through the National Revenue Fund, through the Division of Revenue Act that splits it among spheres, through the equitable share allocations and conditional grants that deliver it to provinces and municipalities, and into the budgets of the departments that are supposed to turn it into services. Along the way, you will see exactly where money gets lost — and what that means for the services that reach you, or fail to.

## Where Your Tax Money Comes From: Inside SARS

The South African Revenue Service (SARS) is the engine of the state's fiscal system. Every rand that the national government spends — every teacher's salary, every social grant payment, every conditional grant to a municipality — begins as revenue collected by SARS or generated by a small number of other sources. Understanding what SARS collects, and from whom, is the first step in following the money.

In the 2024/25 financial year, SARS was projected to collect approximately R2.16 trillion in gross tax revenue, according to the National Treasury's 2024 Budget Review. That figure — over two trillion rand — is enormous in absolute terms but modest relative to the demands placed on it. South Africa's government must fund a public service of approximately 1.3 million employees, transfer money to nine provinces and 257 municipalities, pay social grants to roughly 28 million beneficiaries, service national debt that exceeds R5.2 trillion, and invest in infrastructure that has been deteriorating for decades. The revenue collected by SARS is the fiscal foundation on which all of this rests, and understanding its composition tells you a great deal about the structural constraints the government faces.

Personal income tax is the single largest revenue source, contributing approximately 38% of total tax revenue. This means that a relatively small base of individual taxpayers — approximately 7.4 million registered individual taxpayers who were assessed for income tax in the 2022/23 tax year, according to SARS statistics — funds more than a third of everything government does. In a country of approximately 62 million people, the tax base is narrow. Most South Africans earn below the tax threshold or are outside the formal economy entirely. The burden falls disproportionately on a relatively small formal-sector workforce.

Value-added tax (VAT) is the second-largest source, contributing approximately 25% of total revenue. VAT is a consumption tax — you pay it every time you buy something (with limited exceptions for zero-rated basic foodstuffs like brown bread, rice, maize meal, and fresh vegetables). Unlike income tax, VAT is paid by everyone who consumes, including those too poor to pay income tax. This makes VAT regressive — it takes a larger proportion of a poor household's income than a wealthy household's — but it also makes it the broadest-based tax instrument available.

Corporate income tax contributes approximately 17% of revenue. Fuel levies, customs duties, excise taxes on alcohol and tobacco, the skills development levy, and various smaller taxes and duties make up the remainder. The composition matters because it reveals a structural vulnerability: South Africa's tax revenue is heavily concentrated in a narrow base of personal income taxpayers and a corporate sector whose profitability fluctuates with global commodity cycles. When the economy contracts, tax revenue contracts with it — but the demands on government spending do not.

:::takeaway
SARS collects over R2 trillion annually, but the tax base is narrow. Approximately 7.4 million individual taxpayers fund roughly 38% of government revenue, while VAT — paid by everyone, including the poorest households — contributes another 25%. This narrow base means that economic downturns hit revenue hard, while the spending demands of social grants, public services, and debt servicing remain constant or grow. Every citizen who follows the budget debate should understand this structural constraint: the money available is finite, the demands are enormous, and the political choices about how to divide it have direct consequences for your services.

## The National Revenue Fund: The Constitutional Piggy Bank

Once SARS collects revenue, the money does not go into departmental bank accounts or ministerial discretionary funds. Section 213 of the Constitution establishes the National Revenue Fund (NRF) — a consolidated national account into which all revenue received by the national government must be deposited. No money may be withdrawn from the NRF except through an appropriation by an Act of Parliament or as a direct charge against the fund (which includes constitutionally mandated payments like judges' salaries and the Auditor-General's funding).

This is not a bureaucratic technicality. The NRF is a constitutional safeguard designed to ensure that the executive cannot spend public money without legislative approval. Every rand that SARS collects goes into the NRF. Every rand that government spends must be authorised by Parliament through one of three annual Acts: the Appropriation Act (which funds national departments), the Division of Revenue Act (which funds transfers to provinces and municipalities), and the Adjustments Appropriation Act (which makes mid-year budget changes). The NRF is the choke point of the fiscal system — the single pool from which all government spending flows — and Parliament's control over withdrawals is one of the most important accountability mechanisms in the Constitution.

The practical significance for you is this: when a politician promises a new programme, a new grant, or a new infrastructure project, the money must come from somewhere in the NRF. It must be appropriated by Parliament. It must be reflected in the budget documents that National Treasury publishes every February. If it is not in the budget, it is not funded. If it is not funded, it is a promise, not a plan. The NRF — and the parliamentary appropriation process that governs it — is what separates fiscal accountability from political wish-lists.

## The Great Division: How DORA Splits the Money

In *The Architecture of the State*, you were introduced to the Division of Revenue Act (DORA) — the annual Act of Parliament that determines how nationally raised revenue is divided among the three spheres. Here, we go deeper into how that division actually works, because the mechanics of DORA determine how much money reaches your province and your municipality.

### The Vertical Division

The first and most consequential decision is the vertical division — how the total available revenue is split among national, provincial, and local government in aggregate. This is not a constitutional formula. It is a political negotiation that happens annually, informed by recommendations from the Financial and Fiscal Commission (FFC), an independent constitutional body established under Section 220. The FFC analyses the fiscal needs of each sphere and makes recommendations to Parliament, but its recommendations are advisory, not binding. The actual division is determined by the national executive through the Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS) and confirmed in the annual budget.

In practice, the vertical division has remained remarkably stable over time. National government retains approximately 48–50% of available revenue for its own departments, debt servicing, and contingency reserves. Provinces receive approximately 42–44% through the provincial equitable share and conditional grants. Local government receives approximately 8–10% through the local government equitable share and conditional grants. These proportions shift at the margins from year to year — a new conditional grant here, a fiscal consolidation cut there — but the fundamental structure has been consistent for over two decades.

The stability of this division masks a critical tension. Provincial and municipal responsibilities have grown over time — more learners in schools, more patients in clinics, more households needing free basic services, more infrastructure reaching the end of its lifespan — but the provincial and local government shares have not grown proportionally. National government, meanwhile, faces its own fiscal pressures: a growing public-sector wage bill, escalating debt-service costs (which consumed approximately R356 billion in 2024/25, making it the fastest-growing expenditure item in the national budget), and the fiscal consequences of state-owned enterprises that require bailouts. The result is that every sphere feels fiscally squeezed, and the vertical division becomes a zero-sum negotiation where more for one sphere means less for another.

### The Horizontal Division

Once the vertical division determines how much goes to each sphere in aggregate, the horizontal division determines how each sphere's allocation is shared among its constituent parts. For provinces, the horizontal division distributes the provincial equitable share among nine provinces. For municipalities, the horizontal division distributes the local government equitable share among 257 municipalities.

The provincial equitable share formula — which you were introduced to in *The Architecture of the State* — uses weighted components to distribute money according to provincial need. The education component, which is the largest at approximately 48% of the formula, allocates based on the school-age population and the number of learners enrolled in public ordinary schools. The health component, at approximately 27%, allocates based on the proportion of the population without medical aid (the "risk pool" that depends on public health services). The basic component, at approximately 16%, distributes according to each province's share of the national population. Smaller components account for poverty, economic activity, and institutional capacity.

The formula creates winners and losers. Gauteng, with its large and growing population, receives the largest absolute allocation. But the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, and Limpopo — with larger proportions of poor, uninsured, school-age populations — receive larger per capita allocations relative to their populations. The formula is designed to be redistributive, channelling more resources toward provinces with greater need, but it also means that provinces with large urban tax bases (Gauteng, the Western Cape) receive less per capita than their economic contribution might suggest.

:::expert
The Financial and Fiscal Commission (FFC), in its annual submissions on the Division of Revenue, has consistently documented a structural misalignment between the equitable share formula and actual provincial expenditure needs. The FFC's analysis shows that the education and health components of the formula — which together drive approximately 75% of provincial allocations — are based on demographic proxies (school-age population, uninsured population) rather than on the actual cost of delivering services to acceptable standards. The FFC has noted that provinces with large rural populations face significantly higher per-unit costs for service delivery — transporting learners across vast distances, staffing clinics in remote areas, maintaining infrastructure spread over large geographies — but the formula does not adequately account for these cost differentials. The FFC's 2023/24 submission recommended that the formula incorporate a "rurality" or "sparsity" factor to address this gap, noting that the current formula systematically underfunds provinces where the cost of reaching citizens is highest. This structural underfunding, the FFC argues, contributes to the persistent service delivery gap between urban and rural provinces — a gap that exists not because rural provinces mismanage their resources (though some do) but because the resources allocated are insufficient for the task, given the geography and demographics these provinces serve.

## Two Types of Money: Equitable Share and Conditional Grants

The money that flows from national government to provinces and municipalities comes in two fundamentally different forms, and understanding the difference is essential to following the money accurately.

### The Equitable Share: Unconditional Money

The equitable share — both provincial and municipal — is an unconditional transfer. Once a province or municipality receives its equitable share allocation, it can spend the money according to its own priorities, within its constitutional mandate. National government cannot dictate how a province spends its equitable share — it can set policy frameworks, it can use conditional grants to incentivise specific spending, but the equitable share itself belongs to the receiving sphere.

For provinces, the equitable share is the dominant funding source. In the 2024/25 financial year, the provincial equitable share totalled approximately R596 billion, accounting for roughly 79% of total national transfers to provinces. This money funds the core provincial functions: teacher salaries, hospital and clinic operations, social worker salaries, and the administration of provincial departments. Because education and health together consume approximately 80% of a typical provincial budget, and because the equitable share is calculated largely on the basis of education and health need, the equitable share effectively functions as a health-and-education funding instrument — even though provinces are constitutionally free to allocate it differently.

For municipalities, the equitable share is designed specifically to fund free basic services to poor households. The local government equitable share formula calculates what it costs to provide free basic water (6 kilolitres per household per month), free basic electricity (50 kWh per household per month), free basic sanitation, and free basic refuse removal to indigent households, and allocates accordingly. In the 2024/25 financial year, the local government equitable share totalled approximately R98 billion. For rural municipalities with limited own-revenue bases, this allocation may constitute 80% or more of total revenue. For metropolitan municipalities with substantial property rates and service charge revenue, it is a smaller proportion of the total.

### Conditional Grants: Ring-Fenced Money

Conditional grants are the opposite of the equitable share: they come with strings attached. National government allocates conditional grants for specific purposes, with specific spending conditions, specific reporting requirements, and specific timelines. If a province or municipality fails to spend a conditional grant in accordance with its conditions, national government can withhold the funds, demand repayment, or reallocate them.

The conditional grant system is vast. In the 2024/25 Division of Revenue, there were over 40 conditional grants to provinces and municipalities, ranging from the massive Human Settlements Development Grant (R24.8 billion to provinces for housing delivery) and the Education Infrastructure Grant (R13.7 billion to provinces for school buildings) to smaller allocations like the Provincial Roads Maintenance Grant and the Municipal Water Infrastructure Grant.

Conditional grants serve a legitimate purpose: they allow national government to ensure that national priorities — housing delivery, school infrastructure, water infrastructure, HIV/AIDS treatment — are funded even if provincial or municipal governments would prefer to spend the money elsewhere. But they create a tension that runs through South Africa's entire fiscal architecture. Conditional grants reduce provincial and municipal autonomy. A province that receives R13.7 billion for school infrastructure cannot redirect that money to hospital equipment, even if its hospitals are in worse condition than its schools. A municipality that receives a Municipal Infrastructure Grant for water pipes cannot use it to fix roads, even if the roads are in more urgent need of repair. The conditions reflect national priorities, which may not align with local realities.

The tension deepens when you consider capacity. Spending a conditional grant requires the administrative ability to plan projects, procure contractors, manage construction, report on progress, and account for expenditure. Many municipalities — and some provincial departments — lack this capacity. The result is a perverse pattern documented in every Auditor-General report: underspending. Money is allocated, the conditions are clear, the need is urgent, but the recipient cannot spend the money because it lacks the project management, procurement, or financial management capacity to do so. In the 2022/23 financial year, the Auditor-General reported significant underspending of conditional grants across multiple provinces and municipalities — money that was available for service delivery but was returned unspent to the NRF because the institutions meant to spend it could not.

:::takeaway
The equitable share is unconditional — provinces and municipalities decide how to spend it within their mandate. Conditional grants are ring-fenced for specific purposes. Both have weaknesses. The equitable share can be misspent because there is no national control over its use. Conditional grants can go unspent because recipients lack the capacity to comply with their conditions. The fiscal system's fundamental challenge is not whether to use conditional or unconditional transfers — it is ensuring that the money, however it is classified, actually translates into services you can see and use.

## What Provinces and Municipalities Raise Themselves

The transfers from national government — equitable share plus conditional grants — tell only part of the story. The other part is own revenue: the taxes, fees, and charges that provinces and municipalities collect directly. The distribution of own-revenue capacity across the three spheres is one of the most consequential features of South Africa's fiscal architecture, and one of the least understood.

### Provinces: Almost Entirely Dependent

Provinces raise almost no revenue of their own. The Constitution gives provinces limited taxing powers — Section 228 allows provinces to impose taxes, levies, and duties other than income tax, VAT, sales tax, rates on property, or customs duties, and only if authorised by an Act of Parliament. In practice, provincial own revenue comes from motor vehicle licence fees, gambling taxes and levies, and liquor licence fees — sources that typically account for less than 5% of a province's total budget. In the 2024/25 financial year, even Gauteng — the most economically productive province — generated less than 4% of its budget from own revenue.

This fiscal dependence has profound implications for accountability. When a province raises almost all of its money from national transfers, its accountability relationship runs upward — to National Treasury, which controls the purse strings — rather than downward, to the citizens it serves. A provincial government that funded itself primarily through taxes on its own residents would face direct electoral consequences for poor service delivery: residents who pay for services expect to receive them and will vote accordingly. A provincial government that receives 96% of its funding from national transfers faces a weaker accountability link to its residents. The money comes from Pretoria regardless of performance. The residents vote for the province's governing party, but the party's electoral fortunes are determined more by national politics than by provincial service delivery outcomes.

The question of whether to give provinces greater taxing powers has been debated since 1996. The FFC and various academic researchers have recommended exploring a provincial surcharge on personal income tax — a small additional percentage that provinces could levy on top of the national income tax rate, with the revenue staying in the province. The argument is that this would create a direct fiscal link between provincial government and provincial taxpayers, strengthening downward accountability. The counterargument is that such a surcharge would deepen inequality between rich and poor provinces — Gauteng and the Western Cape would generate substantial additional revenue, while the Eastern Cape and Limpopo would generate very little — and would undermine the redistributive purpose of the current fiscal system. The debate continues, but no provincial taxing powers beyond the existing minor sources have been implemented.

### Municipalities: A Different Fiscal World

Municipalities occupy a fundamentally different fiscal position from provinces. Larger municipalities — particularly the eight metropolitan municipalities — have substantial own-revenue bases. Property rates, service charges (especially the electricity surcharge, which is the single most important municipal revenue source), water tariffs, refuse removal charges, and various fees and licences generate significant income. In the City of Johannesburg, own revenue accounts for approximately 75% of the total budget. In the City of Cape Town, the figure is similar.

The electricity surcharge deserves particular attention because it illustrates a fiscal mechanism that most residents do not understand but that directly affects them. Municipalities purchase bulk electricity from Eskom at a wholesale price and sell it to households and businesses at a marked-up retail price. The difference — the surcharge — is a major revenue source that municipalities use to cross-subsidise other services. When Eskom raises its bulk tariff (as it does annually, subject to the National Energy Regulator of South Africa's approval), municipalities must decide whether to absorb the increase (reducing their surplus), pass it through to consumers (raising your electricity bill), or increase the surcharge (raising your bill further to maintain revenue). The electricity surcharge effectively functions as a local tax — one that is invisible in the sense that it appears on your electricity bill rather than as a separate tax line, but one that funds your roads, parks, and other municipal services.

The problem is that this model works only for municipalities with a substantial base of paying customers. Rural and small-town municipalities — many of which have limited commercial activity, high rates of poverty, and low payment rates for municipal services — have thin own-revenue bases and depend almost entirely on national transfers. The Auditor-General has documented municipalities where own revenue collection has collapsed — where residents refuse to pay for services they are not receiving, where billing systems are broken, where the revenue base has eroded through economic decline or population migration. For these municipalities, the equitable share is not a supplement — it is survival funding.

:::expert
The South African Cities Network (SACN), in its annual *State of South African Cities Report*, has tracked the fiscal divergence between metropolitan and non-metropolitan municipalities over two decades. SACN's data shows that the eight metropolitan municipalities collectively generate approximately 70% of total municipal own revenue nationally, while the remaining 249 municipalities share the other 30%. This concentration means that discussions about "municipal fiscal health" are meaningless without specifying which municipalities are being discussed. The metros operate as financially semi-autonomous entities — their own-revenue bases are large enough to fund the majority of their operations, and national transfers constitute a relatively small supplement. For the roughly 150 municipalities that SACN classifies as having "weak" or "very weak" own-revenue capacity, however, the fiscal reality is entirely different: they depend on national transfers for 60–90% of their budgets, have limited ability to raise additional revenue, and face service delivery demands that exceed their fiscal means regardless of how efficiently they manage. SACN's research demonstrates that this fiscal divergence is structural, not primarily a consequence of management quality — the economic geography of South Africa concentrates taxable economic activity in metropolitan areas, leaving non-metropolitan municipalities with revenue bases that are fundamentally inadequate for the service delivery responsibilities the Constitution assigns to them.

## Where Money Gets Lost in the Pipeline

Following the money from SARS to your services reveals multiple points where money leaks, stalls, or disappears. These leakages are not abstract — they are the reason your services are worse than your taxes should be able to buy. Understanding them gives you a precise vocabulary for describing government failure, rather than resorting to the vague "corruption and incompetence" that dominates public discourse.

### Underspending: Money That Exists but Does Not Move

Underspending is the most counterintuitive failure in the fiscal system. A department or municipality is allocated money in the budget — money that has been raised through taxes, appropriated by Parliament, and earmarked for a specific purpose — and then fails to spend it within the financial year. The money sits in accounts while the services it was meant to fund remain undelivered.

The pattern is pervasive. In the 2022/23 financial year, national and provincial departments collectively underspent their budgets by approximately R20 billion, according to National Treasury's fourth-quarter expenditure data. Conditional grants are particularly prone to underspending: the Education Infrastructure Grant, the Human Settlements Development Grant, and the Municipal Infrastructure Grant all reported significant underspending in recent years. The causes are varied — delayed procurement processes, lack of project management capacity, legal disputes with contractors, land availability problems for housing and infrastructure projects — but the effect is consistent: money available for schools, houses, and water pipes does not get spent, and the facilities do not get built.

Underspending is not the opposite of corruption. It is a distinct pathology. A corrupt department may spend all its money — spending it on inflated contracts, on services not delivered, on tenders awarded to connected individuals — and produce impressive expenditure figures while delivering nothing of value. An underspending department may be honest but incompetent — unable to manage procurement processes, unable to attract project managers, unable to navigate the regulatory requirements of the supply chain management framework. Both pathologies result in citizens not receiving services, but they require different diagnoses and different remedies.

### Irregular Expenditure: Money Spent Outside the Rules

Irregular expenditure is expenditure incurred in contravention of applicable legislation — primarily the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA) for national and provincial departments, and the Municipal Finance Management Act (MFMA) for municipalities. It does not necessarily mean the money was stolen. It means the money was spent in a way that did not comply with the rules: procurement procedures were not followed, competitive bidding was bypassed, contracts were awarded without the required approvals, or spending exceeded approved limits.

The numbers are staggering. In the 2022/23 financial year, the Auditor-General reported irregular expenditure of R53.55 billion across local government alone. National and provincial departments added further tens of billions. The cumulative irregular expenditure figure — the total of all irregular expenditure that has not been resolved through investigation, condonation, or recovery — runs into the hundreds of billions.

The challenge with irregular expenditure is that it encompasses a wide spectrum. At one end, it includes genuine corruption — tenders awarded to politically connected companies at inflated prices, with kickbacks to officials. At the other end, it includes technical non-compliance — a municipality that followed a slightly incorrect procurement procedure but obtained fair value for money. The Auditor-General treats both as irregular expenditure because both violate the rules, but the policy response should differ dramatically. Yet most irregular expenditure is never fully investigated to determine where on this spectrum it falls. It accumulates in the AGSA's reports year after year, unresolved, creating a fiscal accountability deficit that grows larger with every audit cycle.

### Fiscal Dumping: The March Rush

A third leakage pattern, less discussed but equally damaging, is fiscal dumping — the rush to spend allocated budgets in the final quarter of the financial year (January to March) to avoid the appearance of underspending. Departments and municipalities that have spent slowly for three quarters suddenly accelerate expenditure in the fourth quarter, often awarding contracts hastily, with less rigorous due diligence, under enormous time pressure.

National Treasury's quarterly expenditure data consistently shows a spike in spending in the fourth quarter across multiple departments and municipalities. The incentive structure drives this behaviour: underspending carries consequences. An underspending department may have its budget reduced in the following year on the grounds that it clearly did not need the full allocation. An underspending municipality may have its conditional grant reduced or reallocated. So officials rush to spend — not because the projects are ready, not because the procurement has been properly managed, but because returning unspent funds is politically and bureaucratically costly.

The fiscal dumping pattern is particularly damaging for capital projects. A road that should be designed over six months and built over twelve gets contracted in February and rushed to completion by March. A school building that should undergo careful quality inspection gets signed off hastily to meet the financial year deadline. The result is infrastructure that costs the right amount on paper but delivers substandard quality in practice — the leaking roof, the cracking wall, the road surface that deteriorates within a year.

## The Accountability Paradox

South Africa's fiscal architecture creates what governance scholars describe as a principal-agent problem of unusual severity. The entity that collects the money (SARS, a national institution) is not the entity that spends most of it (provinces and municipalities). The entity that designs the policy (a national department) is not the entity that implements it (a provincial department or municipality). The entity that allocates the conditional grant (National Treasury) is not the entity that manages the project the grant funds (a municipal infrastructure unit that may have three staff members).

This separation between payer and spender creates an accountability gap that you can observe in every service delivery failure. When your provincial hospital is understaffed, the provincial health department can point to insufficient funding from National Treasury. National Treasury can point to the province's failure to spend its existing allocation efficiently. Neither sphere is fully wrong. Neither sphere is fully accountable. The money has moved through the pipeline — from SARS to the NRF, from the NRF through DORA to the province, from the provincial treasury to the provincial health department — and at each handoff point, the connection between the taxpayer's money and the service it was meant to fund has become a little more attenuated.

The accountability paradox cuts deepest at the municipal level. A rural municipality that receives 85% of its revenue from national transfers has a weak accountability relationship with its residents. The money does not come from local ratepayers — it comes from Pretoria. The political incentives therefore point upward, toward compliance with national reporting requirements, rather than downward, toward delivering services that residents can see and use. A mayor in such a municipality can preside over years of deteriorating service delivery without facing fiscal consequences — the equitable share will arrive next year regardless. The electoral consequences may be delayed by years, and in a proportional representation system where municipal councillors owe their positions to party lists rather than individual voter approval, even electoral accountability is diluted.

This is not an argument against the fiscal transfer system. South Africa's inequality between provinces and between municipalities is so extreme that a pure own-revenue model — where each municipality funds itself from local taxes — would consign most of the country to destitution. The fiscal transfer system is redistributive by design, and redistribution is a constitutional value. But the system's architects knew that redistribution carries an accountability cost. The FFC has repeatedly recommended strengthening the accountability mechanisms that accompany fiscal transfers — more rigorous performance conditions on grants, more transparent reporting requirements, more meaningful consequences for persistent underperformance. The challenge is implementing these recommendations in a political environment where the officials who would impose the consequences are often from the same political party as the officials who would face them.

:::expert
Research published by the National Treasury's Intergovernmental Relations division, drawing on two decades of DORA implementation data, illustrates the accountability challenge quantitatively. Their analysis of conditional grant spending across municipalities shows that the correlation between grant allocation size and service delivery outcomes (measured by infrastructure completion rates, service coverage expansion, and quality indicators) is weaker than the system's design would predict. Municipalities that receive larger infrastructure grants do not proportionally deliver more infrastructure — the relationship is mediated by institutional capacity, governance quality, and political stability, none of which the grant allocation formula accounts for. National Treasury's own assessment of the conditional grant system has identified a recurring pattern: grants that are accompanied by intensive technical support from national departments (such as the Municipal Infrastructure Support Agency) show significantly better spending and delivery outcomes than grants that simply transfer money with reporting conditions attached. The implication, documented in National Treasury's annual Division of Revenue reports, is that money alone does not solve service delivery problems — and that the fiscal transfer system's effectiveness depends on capacity-building investments that are themselves chronically underfunded.

## A Concrete Example: Following R1 Billion from SARS to Your Street

To make the fiscal pipeline tangible, consider a simplified but realistic example of how money moves from collection to service delivery.

SARS collects income tax from your salary through the Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE) system. Your employer deducts the tax from your gross salary and remits it to SARS, which deposits it into the National Revenue Fund. In February, the Minister of Finance tables the budget in Parliament. The Division of Revenue Bill — which becomes DORA once passed — allocates a portion of the NRF to provinces and municipalities. Among the allocations is the Municipal Infrastructure Grant (MIG), which is designed to fund basic infrastructure in municipalities that lack the own-revenue capacity to fund it themselves.

Your municipality is allocated R150 million from the MIG for the financial year. The grant conditions specify that the money must be spent on new infrastructure or the rehabilitation of existing infrastructure — water pipes, sewer lines, roads, community facilities. The municipality must register projects with the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (COGTA), which administers the MIG. Each project must have an approved business plan. Procurement must follow the municipality's supply chain management policy, which must comply with the MFMA and the Preferential Procurement Policy Framework Act.

Now the pipeline begins to narrow. The municipality's infrastructure unit has two engineers and a project manager — for a municipality responsible for maintaining roads, water, and sanitation across a geographic area the size of a small European country. They register five projects. Two sail through procurement. Two encounter delays — a rejected tender that must be re-advertised, a legal challenge from an unsuccessful bidder. One cannot proceed because the land identified for the project is subject to a dispute that the municipality's legal department has not resolved.

By the end of the third quarter, the municipality has spent R80 million of its R150 million allocation. The two completed projects — a new water pipeline and the rehabilitation of a main road — are delivering services. The two delayed projects are in progress but will not be completed by 31 March. The fifth project has not started. The municipality faces a choice: return R70 million unspent (and risk a reduced allocation next year), or rush the procurement of the delayed projects (and risk irregular expenditure findings from the Auditor-General).

This is not a story about corruption. Nobody stole anything in this example. It is a story about the fiscal pipeline's structural constraints: the gap between the money available and the institutional capacity to spend it effectively. The money was collected, allocated, transferred, and partially spent — but the service delivery outcomes fell short of what the allocation was designed to produce. Multiply this example across 257 municipalities and dozens of conditional grants, and you begin to understand the aggregate picture of South Africa's fiscal system.

## How National Debt Changes the Equation

No account of South Africa's public finances would be complete without confronting the reality of national debt, because debt servicing now competes directly with service delivery for every rand in the National Revenue Fund.

South Africa's gross national debt exceeded R5.2 trillion in the 2024/25 financial year, representing approximately 74% of gross domestic product. The cost of servicing this debt — the interest payments the government must make to bondholders — was projected at approximately R356 billion in 2024/25 (National Treasury, 2024 Budget Review). To put that in perspective, debt-service costs now exceed the entire budget of any single national department. They exceed the total allocation to the Department of Health. They exceed the total equitable share allocation to local government. Debt servicing is the fastest-growing line item in the national budget, and every rand spent on interest payments is a rand that cannot be spent on teachers, nurses, social grants, or infrastructure.

The debt trajectory matters for every citizen who follows the money because it constrains future fiscal choices. If debt-service costs continue to grow, the national government will face increasing pressure to reduce transfers to provinces and municipalities — or to reduce spending on national functions — to keep the fiscal deficit manageable. This is not a theoretical risk. National Treasury's fiscal consolidation programme has already constrained real growth in transfers to provinces, meaning that the money available for provincial health and education has not kept pace with population growth and inflation. Municipal infrastructure grants have similarly been under pressure.

For you, following the money means understanding that the fiscal pipeline has a leak at the very top: before a single rand reaches a province or a municipality, a growing share of nationally raised revenue is diverted to debt servicing. The implications cascade downward. Less money for provinces means tighter hospital budgets and larger class sizes. Less money for municipalities means deferred infrastructure maintenance and reduced service capacity. The debt burden is not an abstraction discussed by economists in Pretoria — it is a direct cause of the service delivery gaps you experience in your daily life.

## The Fiscal Transparency Toolkit: How to Follow the Money Yourself

Everything in this article has been building to this: the practical tools you need to follow the money from national collection to local delivery. South Africa publishes more fiscal data than most countries in the world — the problem is not that the information is secret, but that nobody teaches citizens where to find it, how to read it, and what questions to ask. Here is your starting point.

**The Follow-the-Money Toolkit**

**Step 1: Start with the national budget**

Every February, the Minister of Finance tables the annual budget in Parliament. National Treasury publishes the full budget documentation on its website at [treasury.gov.za](https://www.treasury.gov.za). The key documents for following the money are the Budget Review (the overview of fiscal policy, revenue projections, and expenditure plans), the Division of Revenue Bill (which becomes DORA — showing exactly how much each province and municipality will receive), and the Estimates of National Expenditure (ENE) (which shows what each national department plans to spend, on what, and what it achieved last year). Start with the Budget Review's executive summary. It is written in accessible language and gives you the big picture: how much revenue is expected, how much will be spent, how much will go to debt, and how much will be transferred to provinces and municipalities.

**Step 2: Find your province's allocation**

The Division of Revenue Bill includes annexures that list allocations to each province — both the equitable share and each conditional grant. Find your province and note the total allocation, the breakdown between equitable share and conditional grants, and which conditional grants are largest. Compare these figures to the previous year's allocation. Is your province receiving more or less? In real terms (adjusting for inflation), is the allocation growing or shrinking?

**Step 3: Find your municipality's allocation**

The Division of Revenue Bill also lists allocations to each municipality — the local government equitable share and each conditional grant. Find your municipality. Compare its equitable share to other municipalities of similar size. Check which conditional grants it receives and their amounts.

**Step 4: Check how the money was spent**

The Auditor-General of South Africa (AGSA) audits every national department, provincial department, and municipality annually. These audit reports are published at [agsa.co.za](https://www.agsa.co.za). Look up your province's departments (especially health and education) and your municipality. The audit outcome tells you whether the entity managed its finances properly. A clean audit means the financial statements were accurate and no material compliance or performance issues were found. A qualified audit means there were material problems that the Auditor-General could quantify. An adverse audit or a disclaimer means the financial management has fundamentally broken down.

**Step 5: Compare allocation to outcomes**

The most powerful fiscal accountability tool is comparing the money allocated to the outcomes achieved. If your provincial education department received R60 billion and the class sizes in your child's school are 55, the question is not just "is there enough money?" but "what happened to the money that was allocated?" The Auditor-General's performance audit findings — not just the financial audit — tell you whether the department achieved what it said it would achieve with the money it was given. The Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation (DPME) publishes performance assessments at [dpme.gov.za](https://www.dpme.gov.za). National Treasury publishes quarterly expenditure data showing whether departments are spending on track. Your municipality's annual report — which it is legally required to produce and make publicly available — shows what it achieved against its service delivery targets.

**Where to find the data:**

National Treasury budget documents, Division of Revenue Bill, and expenditure data are available at [treasury.gov.za](https://www.treasury.gov.za). The Auditor-General's reports for national, provincial, and municipal government are available at [agsa.co.za](https://www.agsa.co.za). The Financial and Fiscal Commission's submissions and recommendations are available at [ffc.co.za](https://www.ffc.co.za). SARS tax statistics are available at [sars.gov.za](https://www.sars.gov.za). Municipal budget and financial data is available through National Treasury's municipal finance portal at [municipaldata.treasury.gov.za](https://municipaldata.treasury.gov.za). DPME performance information is available at [dpme.gov.za](https://www.dpme.gov.za).

Following the money is not an advanced skill. It is a basic civic practice that anyone with internet access and the patience to read a government document can perform. The data is public. The institutions that publish it are constitutionally mandated to do so. The question is whether you, as a citizen, choose to use it — and once you do, you will never again accept "there is no money" as an explanation for failed services without checking whether that claim is actually true.

## Where to Go From Here

You now understand the full fiscal pipeline: how SARS collects revenue, how the National Revenue Fund pools it, how DORA divides it among spheres, how the equitable share and conditional grants channel it to provinces and municipalities, how own revenue supplements (or fails to supplement) these transfers, and where money gets lost through underspending, irregular expenditure, and fiscal dumping. You understand the accountability paradox created by the separation between the entity that collects and the entities that spend. And you have a practical toolkit for following the money yourself.

In *The Budget Process*, the next article in this series, we will walk through the annual budget cycle step by step — from the Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement in October through the budget speech in February to the appropriation process in Parliament — so you can understand exactly when the fiscal decisions that affect your life are made and where you can engage with them. In *From Treasury to Your Town*, we will follow the money all the way to the municipal level, examining how the equitable share and conditional grants translate (or fail to translate) into the water, electricity, and refuse services you use every day.

The fiscal system is not a black box. It is a pipeline with public documentation at every joint. Once you learn to read that documentation, you can trace every rand from collection to spending — and hold the officials responsible for each stage of the journey accountable for how they used the money that belongs to you.
