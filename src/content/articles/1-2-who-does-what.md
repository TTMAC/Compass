## The Most Practical Question in South African Governance

In the previous article in this series, *The Architecture of the State*, you learned that South Africa's Constitution divides power across three constitutionally equal spheres—national, provincial, and municipal—each with protected powers. You learned about Schedules 4 and 5, about cooperative governance, about the fiscal transfer system. All of that was necessary groundwork. But here is the question that actually matters when something goes wrong in your life: **who, specifically, is responsible?**

Not which sphere in the abstract. Which department. Which minister or MEC or municipal official. Which budget line. Which office you should be directing your complaint to, your access-to-information request to, your public pressure towards. Because the single biggest reason that citizen pressure fails to produce results in South Africa is not apathy—it is misdirection. You are shouting at the wrong office. You are marching on the wrong building. You are tweeting at the wrong politician. And the official who is actually responsible for your problem is sitting comfortably, unscrutinised, because nobody knows their name.

This article is the map. It takes the constitutional architecture from Article 1.1 and translates it into a practical, service-by-service guide to who does what across all three spheres. By the end, you will know exactly which department, which official, and which sphere is responsible for the services that affect your daily life—and what to do when responsibilities overlap, when they are delegated, or when the responsible party simply is not doing their job.

## The National Government Machine: Departments, Ministers, and Directors-General

National government is the most visible sphere—the president, the cabinet, Parliament, the Union Buildings—but it is also the sphere that most South Africans misunderstand. National government does not, for the most part, deliver services directly to you. Its primary functions are setting policy, passing legislation, regulating sectors, and transferring money to the other two spheres so they can deliver services. There are important exceptions—the South African Police Service, the South African Social Security Agency, the Department of Home Affairs—but the general principle holds: national government designs the system, it does not run the taps.

As of the seventh administration, the national executive consists of the president, the deputy president, and ministers heading approximately 30 national departments. Each department is led politically by a minister (sometimes assisted by a deputy minister) and administratively by a director-general (DG). The minister sets policy direction and is accountable to Parliament. The DG manages the department's operations, controls its budget, and is the accounting officer responsible for financial compliance. When something goes wrong in a national department, the question of whether the failure is political (the minister's policy choices) or administrative (the DG's management) matters enormously—but from the outside, both are accountable.

Here are the national departments whose functions most directly affect your life, and what they actually do.

### The Department of Basic Education

The national Department of Basic Education (DBE) sets curriculum policy, administers the National Senior Certificate (matric) examinations, develops the Curriculum and Assessment Policy Statements (CAPS), and manages the national school nutrition programme. It does not run schools. It does not hire teachers. It does not fix school roofs. Those are provincial functions. The DBE sets the rules of the game—what is taught, how it is assessed, what norms and standards schools must meet—and then transfers funding to provinces through conditional grants like the Education Infrastructure Grant. When your child's school has no textbooks, the question is whether the DBE has procured and dispatched them (a national function) or whether the provincial education department has failed to distribute them (a provincial function). The Limpopo textbook crisis of 2012, which resulted in a Constitutional Court order in Minister of Basic Education v Basic Education for All, demonstrated how a failure that appeared to be provincial was ultimately traced back to both spheres.

### The Department of Health

The national Department of Health sets health policy, regulates health professionals through the Health Professions Council of South Africa, manages the framework for National Health Insurance, and operates certain specialised facilities and programmes including the national response to HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. Provincial departments of health run the hospitals and clinics. When you cannot get an appointment at your local clinic, when the clinic has no medication, when the ambulance takes three hours to arrive—these are overwhelmingly provincial failures, not national ones. The national department's failures tend to be structural: policy that does not match implementation reality, regulation that is not enforced, or conditional grant funding that comes with conditions provinces cannot meet.

### The South African Police Service

SAPS is one of the few national functions that delivers a service directly to you. The Minister of Police heads the department, and the National Commissioner commands the service. Every police station in the country, every detective, every visible policing unit falls under national government. When your neighbourhood is plagued by crime, when your case docket disappears, when the police take four hours to respond to an emergency call—that is a national government failure. Provincial governments have a constitutional oversight role over policing (Section 206 of the Constitution allows provincial executives to monitor police conduct and investigate complaints), and municipalities can establish metropolitan police services with limited powers, but the core policing function is national. The station commander at your local police station reports up through a chain that ends at the National Commissioner and the Minister of Police.

### The Department of Home Affairs

Home Affairs is another direct-service national department. Identity documents, birth certificates, passports, marriage certificates, immigration and asylum processing—all of these are national functions delivered through Home Affairs offices across the country. When you queue for five hours to collect an ID, when your passport application takes four months, when a birth certificate is lost in the system—you are dealing with a national department's operational failures. There is no provincial or municipal equivalent. Home Affairs is entirely a national function.

### The South African Social Security Agency

SASSA, an agency of the national Department of Social Development, administers social grants—the old age pension, the child support grant, the disability grant, the social relief of distress grant (SRD or R350 grant), and others. In the 2024/25 financial year, SASSA distributed grants to approximately 28 million beneficiaries, making it the largest direct-service delivery mechanism in national government. When your grant payment is late, when you are incorrectly removed from the system, when the SASSA office cannot process your application—that is a national government failure. Provincial departments of social development handle welfare services like social work, child protection, and substance abuse programmes, but the grants themselves are entirely national.

:::takeaway
National government's direct-service departments—SAPS, Home Affairs, SASSA—are the exceptions, not the rule. For most services that affect your daily life, national government's role is to set policy and transfer money to provinces and municipalities. When a national department fails, the failure is usually in policy design, regulatory enforcement, or funding allocation—not in direct service delivery. The critical exception is policing, identity documents, and social grants, where national government is the direct service provider and cannot shift blame to another sphere.

## The Provincial Government Machine: MECs, HODs, and the Services Closest to You

Provincial government is where the Constitution's design meets your daily reality in the most consequential way. Nine provinces, each with a premier, an executive council of Members of the Executive Council (MECs), and provincial departments headed by Heads of Department (HODs). Provincial government runs your schools, your hospitals, your clinics, your ambulances, your provincial roads, and your libraries. It is the implementation sphere—taking national policy frameworks and turning them into functioning services on the ground.

Each province has its own configuration of departments, but the core ones are consistent: Education, Health, Human Settlements, Public Works and Infrastructure, Social Development, Community Safety, Agriculture, Finance, and the Office of the Premier. The MEC is the political head, accountable to the provincial legislature. The HOD is the administrative head and accounting officer. This distinction—political accountability through the MEC, administrative accountability through the HOD—is essential for directing your pressure to the right person.

### Provincial Education Departments

Your child's teacher was hired by the provincial education department. The school's governing body may have recommended the appointment, but the employment contract is with the provincial department. Teacher salaries, school infrastructure maintenance, the allocation of teachers to schools (the post-provisioning process), scholar transport, school feeding programmes (jointly with the national DBE), and the management of public schools—all provincial. When a school has 60 learners in a classroom, when a teaching post has been vacant for six months, when the school roof collapses and nobody repairs it—these are provincial education department failures.

The provincial education MEC is politically responsible. But the operational decisions—which schools get new classrooms, how teachers are distributed across districts, which infrastructure projects are prioritised—are made by the HOD and the district directors who report to them. South Africa's education system is divided into approximately 75 education districts across the nine provinces, each managed by a district director. These district offices are the interface between provincial policy and your child's school, and they are frequently where implementation breaks down.

:::expert
Professor Nicky Roberts, a mathematics education researcher at the University of Johannesburg who has worked extensively with provincial education departments, describes the district office as "the black hole of education administration." In her research on curriculum implementation in Gauteng and Limpopo, Roberts found that district offices are chronically understaffed, with subject advisors responsible for supporting hundreds of schools each. "The national curriculum is well-designed," Roberts observes, "and the provincial department has the formal structures to implement it. But between the provincial head office and the school, you have a district office with three maths advisors covering 200 schools. The policy intention evaporates somewhere on the N1 between Polokwane and the rural school that has not seen a curriculum advisor in two years. When parents complain about education quality, they blame the minister in Pretoria. The actual bottleneck is a vacant post in a district office in Sekhukhune."
:::

### Provincial Health Departments

Provincial health departments operate South Africa's public hospitals and primary healthcare clinics. The MEC for Health is politically responsible, and the HOD manages the department's operations and its budget—which, in most provinces, is the largest single departmental budget. In Gauteng, for example, the health department's budget for 2024/25 was approximately R65 billion, accounting for roughly a third of the province's total budget.

When you arrive at a public hospital and wait eight hours in the emergency department, when the hospital pharmacy has run out of chronic medication, when the maternity ward is understaffed and patients are sharing beds—these are provincial failures. The specific failures can usually be traced to a chain: the HOD's resource allocation decisions, the hospital CEO's management, the clinical manager's staffing choices. Provincial health departments employ hundreds of thousands of people—Gauteng Health alone has over 80,000 employees—and the management challenge is immense.

The one area where the lines blur is primary healthcare. The National Health Act provides for certain municipal health functions, and historically some metropolitan municipalities operated primary healthcare clinics. However, the trend has been toward provincialising primary healthcare, with provinces assuming responsibility for clinics that were previously municipal. This transfer has been uneven and sometimes contentious, with municipalities arguing that provincial management has worsened services at transferred clinics.

### Provincial Human Settlements (Housing)

Housing delivery in South Africa is a shared function that requires all three spheres to work together, but the provincial Department of Human Settlements is the primary implementation agent. National government sets housing policy and provides funding through the Human Settlements Development Grant. The provincial department manages housing projects—identifying beneficiaries, appointing contractors, overseeing construction, and allocating completed houses. Municipalities provide land, bulk infrastructure (water, sewerage, electricity connections), and land-use approvals.

When your RDP house has cracks in the walls six months after you moved in, the provincial human settlements department is primarily responsible—it appointed the contractor, it should have conducted quality inspections, and it controls the rectification programme for defective houses. But the delays in housing delivery—South Africa's housing backlog stood at approximately 2.3 million units in 2023, according to the Department of Human Settlements—often trace to failures in all three spheres simultaneously: national funding constraints, provincial project management weaknesses, and municipal delays in land identification and infrastructure provision.

### Ambulance Services

Emergency medical services—ambulances—are an exclusively provincial function under Schedule 5 of the Constitution. The provincial Department of Health typically manages EMS through a dedicated sub-directorate. When the ambulance takes 90 minutes to reach you in a medical emergency, that is a provincial failure. Not national, not municipal. The province funds the ambulances, employs the paramedics, and manages the dispatch system. This is one of the clearest lines of accountability in South Africa's governance architecture, and one of the most frequently misunderstood—many citizens call their municipality to complain about ambulance response times when the municipality has no role in the service.

:::takeaway
Provincial government is the implementation sphere for South Africa's two largest social services—education and health—together accounting for approximately 80% of most provincial budgets. The MEC sets political direction and is accountable to the provincial legislature; the HOD is the administrative head and accounting officer. When schools and hospitals fail, the accountability chain runs through the provincial department, not through national government (which sets policy and provides funding) or municipal government (which has no role in these functions). Ambulances are exclusively provincial. Housing delivery is primarily provincial, with national funding and municipal land and infrastructure.

## The Municipal Government Machine: Where Services Meet Your Street

Municipal government is where governance becomes tangible. The water from your tap, the electricity powering your lights, the refuse truck that collects your bins, the road surface you drive on, the streetlight outside your house, the local park your children play in—all municipal. South Africa's 257 municipalities—8 metropolitan, 44 district, and 205 local—are constitutionally responsible for the services that most directly determine your quality of life.

A municipality is governed by a council of elected councillors, led by a mayor (or executive mayor in executive systems). The administrative head is the municipal manager, who is the accounting officer and controls the municipality's operations. Below the municipal manager sit directors heading the municipality's various departments—infrastructure, finance, community services, planning, and so on.

The distinction between the political structure (mayor, councillors, mayoral committee members) and the administrative structure (municipal manager, directors) is critical for accountability. The mayor sets political priorities and chairs the mayoral committee. The municipal manager runs the administration and is personally liable for financial management under the Municipal Finance Management Act (MFMA). When a service fails, you need to determine whether the failure is political (the council chose not to prioritise your area, or appointed an unqualified municipal manager) or administrative (the officials failed to execute an approved plan and budget).

### Water and Sanitation

Water service delivery involves two distinct functions split across spheres, and understanding the split is essential. Bulk water supply—the dams, the major treatment works, the trunk mains that carry water across regions—is managed by the national Department of Water and Sanitation and water boards. Rand Water supplies bulk water to Gauteng and parts of surrounding provinces. Umgeni Water serves KwaZulu-Natal. Other water boards and schemes serve other regions.

Water reticulation—the network of pipes that carries water from the municipal reservoir to your tap, the local treatment works, the billing and metering system—is a municipal function. When your water pressure drops, when your tap runs brown, when your water bill is wrong, your municipality is responsible. The exception is when the bulk supply itself is interrupted—if Rand Water cannot supply Johannesburg, the City's reticulation network has nothing to distribute, regardless of how well maintained it is.

Sanitation follows a similar pattern. The municipal sewer network, the local wastewater treatment works, and the maintenance of the system are municipal functions. When sewage overflows into the street—a distressingly common occurrence in many South African municipalities—the responsibility lies squarely with the municipality. In the 2023 Green Drop report, which assesses the performance of wastewater treatment works, the Department of Water and Sanitation found that only 23% of South Africa's wastewater systems achieved a Green Drop score above 50%, indicating a systemic municipal failure in sanitation management.

### Electricity Distribution

If you are a municipal electricity customer—and most urban South Africans are—your municipality buys bulk electricity from Eskom and distributes it to your home. The municipality maintains the local distribution network (substations, transformers, the cable to your meter), reads your meter, and bills you. The surcharge your municipality adds to the Eskom bulk tariff is a major source of municipal revenue—often the largest single revenue line in a municipality's budget.

When load shedding hits, that is an Eskom problem—a national government entity's failure to maintain adequate generation capacity. When your power goes out on a day without load shedding, that is almost certainly a municipal distribution failure—a blown transformer, a cable fault, a maintenance backlog. When your electricity bill is incorrect or your prepaid meter malfunctions, that is municipal.

Some areas—typically rural areas and certain mining towns—are supplied directly by Eskom rather than through the municipality. In those areas, Eskom is both the bulk supplier and the distributor, and the municipality has no role. Knowing whether you are a municipal or Eskom customer is the first step in directing your complaint correctly. Check your electricity bill: if it comes from the municipality, the municipality is your distributor; if it comes from Eskom directly, Eskom is.

### Refuse Removal and Solid Waste

Refuse collection is an exclusively municipal function—Schedule 5, Part B of the Constitution. Your municipality collects your bins, operates the transfer stations, and manages the landfill sites. When the refuse truck does not arrive on collection day, when illegal dumping proliferates because the municipality has not provided adequate waste collection infrastructure, when the landfill is overflowing—all municipal failures.

This is one of the most visible municipal functions and one of the most common sources of service delivery complaints. It is also one of the most straightforward in terms of accountability: there is no other sphere to blame. The municipality funds refuse removal from service charges on your municipal bill and from its equitable share allocation. If the truck does not come, the municipality is responsible—full stop.

### Local Roads, Stormwater, and Street Lighting

Municipal roads—the streets in your neighbourhood, the roads in your business district—are a municipal function. Potholes on a municipal road are the municipality's problem. But not every road is a municipal road. Provincial roads—the routes connecting towns, the secondary roads in rural areas—are the province's responsibility, managed by the provincial Department of Public Works and Roads (or equivalent). National roads—the N1, N2, N3, and other routes marked with an "N" prefix—are managed by the South African National Roads Agency (SANRAL), a national entity.

When you hit a pothole, the first question is: whose road is it? If you are on a street in your suburb, it is almost certainly municipal. If you are on a numbered route between towns (the R-roads, the P-roads), it may be provincial. If you are on an N-route, it is national (SANRAL). This distinction matters because complaining to your municipality about a pothole on a national highway is futile—they have no jurisdiction and no budget for it.

Stormwater drainage and street lighting are exclusively municipal functions. When the intersection floods during every rainstorm because the stormwater system is blocked or undersized, or when street lights have been out for months, your municipality is responsible.

:::expert
Dr Geci Karuri-Sebina, a former executive at the South African Cities Network who has researched urban governance for over two decades, describes municipal service delivery as "the front line of the social contract." In her work with metropolitan municipalities, Karuri-Sebina has documented how the sheer scope of municipal responsibilities—water, electricity, refuse, roads, stormwater, land use planning, building control, firefighting, environmental health, local transport—creates what she calls "the competence crush." "A municipality like eThekwini or the City of Johannesburg is expected to operate like a major corporation—billions of rands in revenue, tens of thousands of employees, massive infrastructure portfolios—but with the governance structure of a political institution. The technical demands are enormous: you need engineers, accountants, planners, IT specialists, environmental scientists, fleet managers. But the appointment process is political, the council turnover disrupts institutional memory, and the salary scales cannot compete with the private sector for scarce skills. The gap between what municipalities are constitutionally required to do and what they have the capacity to do is the defining challenge of South African governance."

## The Grey Zones: Delegations, Assignments, and Shared Functions

The neat divisions described above break down in several ways that you need to understand to navigate the system effectively.

### Agency and Delegation

A municipality can agree to perform a function on behalf of another sphere, or a province can delegate a function to a municipality. These arrangements are governed by Section 238 of the Constitution and various sector-specific legislation. For example, some municipalities perform primary healthcare functions on behalf of the province under a service-level agreement. Some municipalities act as agents for provincial housing delivery. When a function has been delegated or assigned, the accountability picture changes: the receiving municipality is responsible for delivery, but the delegating sphere retains overall accountability and should be monitoring performance.

In practice, these delegation arrangements are frequently underfunded and poorly monitored. The municipality performs the function but does not receive adequate compensation from the delegating sphere, leading to service deterioration. When you encounter a service that seems to fall between spheres—a municipal clinic that is technically under provincial authority, or a housing project where the municipality is the implementing agent for the province—the delegation agreement determines who is accountable, and obtaining clarity on that agreement may require a Promotion of Access to Information Act (PAIA) request.

### District and Local Municipality Splits

Outside metropolitan areas, the 44 district municipalities and 205 local municipalities share municipal functions between them. The Municipal Structures Act determines the default split: districts are responsible for bulk water supply and sanitation (within the municipal sphere), district roads, firefighting services, and municipal health services. Local municipalities handle most direct service delivery—refuse removal, local roads, building control, local land-use planning.

However, the MEC for Local Government in each province can adjust these allocations, and many districts have different arrangements from the default. Some district municipalities have retained water and sanitation functions; others have authorised local municipalities to perform them. This creates confusion for residents—if you live in a local municipality within a district, you may not know whether your water is a district or local municipal responsibility. Your municipal bill should indicate which municipality is billing you for which service, but the institutional arrangements are not always transparent.

### State-Owned Entities

Several national government functions are performed not by departments but by state-owned entities (SOEs) that operate at arm's length from the minister. Eskom generates and transmits electricity. Transnet operates the national freight rail network, ports, and fuel pipelines. SANRAL manages the national road network. The Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (PRASA) operates Metrorail commuter trains and Shosholoza Meyl long-distance rail. The South African Post Office (SAPO) provides postal services. Each of these entities is governed by a board, managed by a CEO, and reports to a minister—but the minister's direct control over operations is limited by the entity's governance structure.

When Metrorail trains are late, cancelled, or unsafe, that is a PRASA failure—a national SOE reporting to the Minister of Transport. When freight logistics are bottlenecked at ports, that is Transnet—reporting to the Minister of Public Enterprises (or the Minister of Transport, depending on the administration's portfolio structure). The responsible minister can be questioned in Parliament, and the SOE's annual report and financial statements are subject to parliamentary oversight, but the operational failures sit with the entity's management and board.

## A Service-by-Service Accountability Map

Let us now consolidate everything into a comprehensive, service-by-service map. For each service you are likely to encounter, this section identifies the responsible sphere, the specific department or entity, and the political official you should hold accountable.

### Education

Schools from Grade R through Grade 12 are a provincial responsibility. The provincial Department of Education or Department of Basic Education (naming varies by province) runs the schools. The MEC for Education is politically accountable. The HOD is the administrative head. National government's role is policy (curriculum, examinations, norms and standards) through the national DBE and the Minister of Basic Education. Universities and TVET colleges are national—managed by the Department of Higher Education and Training.

If your concern is about what is being taught (curriculum content), direct it nationally—to the DBE. If your concern is about how your school is being run (teacher vacancies, infrastructure, school nutrition), direct it provincially—to the MEC and HOD for Education, and to the district director responsible for your school's district.

### Healthcare

Public hospitals and clinics are provincial. The provincial Department of Health runs them. The MEC for Health is politically accountable. If you have a complaint about a specific facility, the hospital CEO or clinic manager is the first point of contact, escalating to the district health manager, then the HOD, then the MEC. National government sets health policy, regulates health professionals, and manages national programmes (HIV/AIDS treatment protocols, COVID-19 vaccination, national health laboratory services through the NHLS). The national Minister of Health is accountable for policy failures and national programme performance.

Environmental health—food safety inspections, monitoring of pollution, investigating health hazards from poor sanitation—is a municipal function in metropolitan areas and a district municipal function elsewhere.

### Housing

Provincial Department of Human Settlements is the primary delivery agent. The MEC is politically accountable. National government provides funding and policy through the national Department of Human Settlements and the Minister. Municipalities provide land, zoning approvals, and bulk infrastructure. When a housing project stalls, all three spheres may share responsibility, but the provincial department is the implementation lead and usually the appropriate first target for accountability.

### Policing and Safety

SAPS is national. The Minister of Police and the National Commissioner are accountable. Your local station commander is accountable for your station's performance. For complaints about police conduct, you can approach the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID), also a national entity, or the provincial MEC who has constitutional oversight powers over policing. Metropolitan police services, where they exist, are municipal—but their powers are limited compared to SAPS, covering mainly by-law enforcement, traffic policing, and crime prevention patrols.

### Social Grants

SASSA is a national agency. The Minister of Social Development is politically accountable. For application and payment problems, contact SASSA directly or the Department of Social Development. Provincial departments of social development handle welfare services—foster care, adoption, social work services, substance abuse programmes—but not grant payments.

### Identity Documents and Civic Services

Department of Home Affairs, national. The Minister of Home Affairs is accountable. There is no provincial or municipal alternative. For documentation services—IDs, passports, birth and death certificates, marriage certificates—Home Affairs is the sole service provider.

### Public Transport

This is one of the most fragmented service areas. Metrorail commuter rail is PRASA (national). Bus Rapid Transit systems like MyCiTi (Cape Town), Rea Vaya (Johannesburg), and A Re Yeng (Tshwane) are municipal. Provincial subsidised bus services are managed by provincial transport departments. Minibus taxis are regulated by provincial regulatory entities but operate largely independently. The national Department of Transport sets policy, administers the public transport operations grant that funds subsidised bus services, and oversees PRASA. Municipal public transport functions include municipal bus services, traffic management, and local transport planning.

When your Metrorail train is cancelled, that is PRASA (national). When a municipal bus route is cut, that is the municipality. When provincial bus subsidies are reduced and routes are cancelled, that is the province.

### Water

Bulk supply: national (Department of Water and Sanitation, water boards). Reticulation and billing: municipal. If you are in a district municipal area, check whether water is a district or local function—it varies. Complaints about water quality should go to the municipality (if it is a reticulation issue) or the water board/national department (if it is a bulk supply issue). The Blue Drop and Green Drop reports from the Department of Water and Sanitation provide public data on drinking water and wastewater quality by municipality—use these to hold your municipality accountable with evidence.

### Electricity

Generation and transmission: Eskom (national SOE, reporting to the Minister of Electricity and Energy). Distribution: municipal (if you are a municipal customer) or Eskom (if you are supplied directly). Load shedding is a generation problem—national. Local outages are distribution problems—municipal or Eskom, depending on your supply arrangement.

:::expert
Professor Odette Sobczak, a public administration scholar at the University of the Western Cape who has studied municipal governance across all nine provinces, points to the fragmentation of public transport as the most damaging consequence of South Africa's multi-sphere governance design for ordinary citizens. "A person in Khayelitsha who commutes to the Cape Town CBD uses a minibus taxi regulated by the province, a MyCiTi bus run by the city, and might also use a Metrorail train run by a national entity," Sobczak notes. "Three spheres of government, three different regulatory regimes, three different funding models, three different accountability structures—for a single commute. When the system fails, and it fails daily for millions of commuters, there is no single authority responsible. The commuter cannot lodge a complaint about 'public transport' because public transport does not exist as a unified function in South African law. It is fragmented across spheres by constitutional design, and the attempts to integrate it—the Integrated Transport Plans that municipalities are required to produce—are planning documents, not operational instruments. The transport crisis is a governance crisis, and the governance crisis is a constitutional design consequence."

## When Nobody Takes Responsibility: The Accountability Gap

The most frustrating scenario you will encounter is not a clear failure by a single sphere—it is a failure that falls between spheres, where each sphere points at the others and nobody takes responsibility. These accountability gaps are structural, not accidental. They arise from the cooperative governance design, which assumes that spheres will coordinate in good faith but provides limited mechanisms for forcing coordination when they do not.

Water contamination provides a vivid example. When the water from your tap is unsafe, the cause might be a failure at the municipal treatment works (municipal), contamination of the source water by upstream pollution (national Department of Water and Sanitation's regulatory failure), or a failure of the provincial health department to issue a health alert and provide emergency safe water. The Hammanskraal water crisis of 2023 illustrated this perfectly: the City of Tshwane's Rooiwal Wastewater Treatment Works was discharging inadequately treated sewage into the Apies River upstream of the Temba Water Treatment Works, contaminating the drinking water supply. Residents fell ill with cholera. The city blamed the water board. The water board blamed the city's sewage discharge. The national department blamed both. The province was slow to declare a health emergency. The result was a multi-sphere failure in which every sphere could point to another's contribution—and residents paid the price with their health.

In these situations, you need to pursue accountability with all responsible spheres simultaneously. Direct complaints and access-to-information requests to the municipality, the provincial health department, and the national department. Engage the relevant parliamentary portfolio committee (Water and Sanitation) and the relevant provincial legislature committee. Contact the South African Human Rights Commission, which has the constitutional power to investigate and recommend remedies. And use the data—the Blue Drop and Green Drop reports, the Auditor-General's findings, the municipal annual report—to build an evidence-based case that makes it difficult for any sphere to deflect blame.

## The Officials You Need to Know

For every service, there is a chain of officials responsible. Here is a practical guide to the key officials at each sphere and how to reach them.

At the national level, the minister is the political head and can be questioned through Parliament's portfolio committees. The DG is the administrative head and accounting officer—financial mismanagement is ultimately the DG's responsibility. The deputy minister (where one exists) often has delegated functions. National entities (SASSA, SAPS, PRASA) have their own CEOs or commissioners who are operationally responsible.

At the provincial level, the premier heads the provincial executive but does not run individual departments. The MEC heads the department and is accountable to the provincial legislature. The HOD is the administrative head. In education and health, the district directors and hospital CEOs are the operational officials closest to service delivery. The provincial legislature's portfolio committees oversee each department.

At the municipal level, the mayor or executive mayor sets political direction. The speaker chairs the council. Mayoral committee members (equivalent to provincial MECs) oversee specific portfolios. The municipal manager is the accounting officer and the most senior administrative official. Directors head operational departments. Your ward councillor is your direct representative and should be your first point of contact for local service delivery issues—they sit on the council that approves the budget and appoints the municipal manager.

The Auditor-General's annual reports are your most powerful accountability tool at all three levels. These reports identify irregular expenditure, fruitless and wasteful expenditure, and material financial misstatements. They name the accounting officers (DGs, HODs, municipal managers) responsible. They are public documents, available at agsa.co.za, and they provide the evidence base for informed accountability.

## The Practical Toolkit: Finding and Engaging the Right Official

:::framework
**The "Who Does What" Decision Framework**

When you encounter a service delivery problem, use this five-step process to identify the responsible sphere, department, and official—and then engage them effectively.

**Step 1: Identify the service and the responsible sphere.**

Use the accountability map above. Is it water reticulation (municipal), a school problem (provincial), a policing failure (national), or an ambulance delay (provincial)? If you are unsure, ask: who bills me for this service? If you get a municipal bill, it is municipal. If it is a government service with no bill (schools, clinics, police), check whether it is listed in Schedule 4 (concurrent—likely provincial implementation with national policy) or Schedule 5 (exclusive—check Part A for provincial, Part B for municipal).

**Step 2: Identify the specific department and official.**

National: which department? Who is the minister and DG? Provincial: which department? Who is the MEC and HOD? Municipal: which directorate? Who is the municipal manager and the relevant director? Your ward councillor should be able to tell you the correct municipal department. Provincial and national department contact details are published on government websites and in the Government Directory available at gov.za.

**Step 3: Check the performance data.**

Before engaging, arm yourself with evidence. The Auditor-General's reports (agsa.co.za) tell you whether the department has a clean audit or a history of financial problems. The DPME's Management Performance Assessment Tool provides performance ratings for national and provincial departments. Municipal financial data is available through National Treasury's municipal data portal. The Blue Drop and Green Drop reports assess water and sanitation performance. These public data sources transform your complaint from an anecdote into an evidence-based accountability demand.

**Step 4: Engage through the right channel.**

For municipal issues, start with your ward councillor and escalate to the municipal manager's office. For provincial issues, contact the MEC's office or the relevant provincial legislature committee. For national issues, contact the minister's office or the relevant parliamentary portfolio committee. For all spheres, a Promotion of Access to Information Act (PAIA) request can force the release of reports, budgets, and plans that reveal what the department knew and when. PAIA requests must be responded to within 30 days.

**Step 5: Escalate when the responsible sphere fails to respond.**

If the responsible sphere does not respond or act, escalate to the oversight bodies. The Public Protector investigates maladministration and improper conduct. The South African Human Rights Commission investigates rights violations including socio-economic rights (water, housing, healthcare). The Auditor-General audits financial management and compliance. Parliamentary and provincial legislature portfolio committees can summon ministers, MECs, and officials to account. The courts are the final recourse—the Constitution's Bill of Rights gives you the right to take government to court for failing to fulfil its constitutional obligations.

This framework will not solve South Africa's service delivery problems on its own. But it will ensure that your energy—your complaints, your requests, your pressure—reaches the officials who actually have the power and the budget to fix the problem. That is the difference between venting and accountability.

## Where to Go From Here

You now have the operational map that complements the constitutional architecture from the previous article. You know that national government sets policy and delivers policing, identity documents, and social grants directly. You know that provincial government runs schools, hospitals, clinics, ambulances, and housing delivery. You know that municipal government is responsible for water reticulation, electricity distribution, refuse removal, local roads, stormwater, and street lighting. You know how to identify the specific department and official responsible for any given service. And you have a five-step framework for turning that knowledge into effective accountability.

In the next article in this series, *How the Spheres Interact*, we will examine how the cooperative governance system works in practice—the intergovernmental forums, the coordination mechanisms, and the intervention powers that activate when a sphere fails. Understanding who does what is the first step; understanding how the spheres are supposed to work together, and what happens when they do not, is the next.
