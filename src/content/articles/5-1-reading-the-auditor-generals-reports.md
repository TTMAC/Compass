## The Report Card Nobody Reads

In *Following the Money*, you traced how SARS collects over R2 trillion in revenue and how that money flows through the National Revenue Fund, through the Division of Revenue Act, and into the budgets of departments and municipalities that are supposed to turn it into services. In *The Budget Process*, you learned when and how those fiscal decisions are made. In *Making Public Submissions*, you learned how to participate in the legislative processes that shape those decisions. But there is a question that every article in this series has been building toward: once the money has been allocated and spent, how do you know whether it was spent properly?

The answer is the Auditor-General of South Africa.

The Auditor-General of South Africa (AGSA) is the institution that audits every national department, every provincial department, every municipality, every public entity, and every constitutional institution — every year. AGSA's reports are the most comprehensive, systematic, and authoritative assessment of government financial management that exists in South Africa. They tell you whether the entity that received your tax money kept accurate books, complied with the law, and delivered on its promises. They are, in effect, the annual report card for every organ of state.

Here is the bottom line: AGSA's reports are public. They are published online. They are written in structured, consistent formats that, once you learn to read them, make government accountability accessible to any citizen willing to invest the time. Yet almost nobody outside of Parliament, the accounting profession, and a handful of civil society organisations reads them. The gap between the information that AGSA publishes and the information that citizens actually use is one of the largest accountability deficits in South African democracy.

This article closes that gap. By the end of it, you will understand what AGSA is, what it audits, what its five audit outcomes mean, how to find and read the reports, and — most importantly — how to use what you find to hold your government accountable.

## The Constitutional Watchdog: What AGSA Is and Why It Matters

The Auditor-General is not a department. It is not a ministry. It is a constitutional institution — one of the Chapter 9 institutions established by the Constitution to strengthen democracy. Section 188 of the Constitution mandates the Auditor-General to audit and report on the accounts, financial statements, and financial management of all national and provincial state departments and administrations, all municipalities, and any other institution or accounting entity required by national or provincial legislation to be audited.

Two features of AGSA's constitutional design are critical to its function.

First, AGSA is independent. Section 181 of the Constitution provides that Chapter 9 institutions are independent, subject only to the Constitution and the law, and that no person or organ of state may interfere with their functioning. The Auditor-General is appointed by the President on the recommendation of the National Assembly for a fixed, non-renewable term of seven years. The current Auditor-General, Tsakani Maluleke — the first woman to hold the position — took office on 1 December 2020. The non-renewable term is a deliberate design choice: an Auditor-General who cannot be reappointed has no incentive to soften findings to please the executive.

Second, AGSA's mandate is comprehensive. Every organ of state that spends public money is subject to AGSA's audit. There is no exemption for politically powerful departments, no carve-out for state-owned enterprises, no opt-out for municipalities that would prefer not to be scrutinised. The Public Audit Act 25 of 2004 gives legislative effect to Sections 188 and 189 of the Constitution, establishing the detailed framework for how AGSA conducts its audits, what it reports on, and to whom.

AGSA audits three distinct dimensions of every entity it examines:

1. **Financial statements** — whether the entity's books are accurate and free from material misstatements. Did the entity record its income and expenditure correctly? Do the numbers add up? Can the financial statements be relied upon as a true reflection of the entity's financial position?

2. **Performance information** — whether the entity's reported performance against its predetermined objectives is useful and reliable. If a provincial education department claims it built 50 schools, did it actually build 50 schools? If a municipality claims it connected 10,000 households to water, is that figure supported by evidence?

3. **Compliance with legislation** — whether the entity complied with the laws and regulations applicable to financial matters. Did it follow proper procurement procedures? Did it stay within its approved budget? Did it manage its assets and liabilities in accordance with the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA) or the Municipal Finance Management Act (MFMA)?

These three dimensions — financial accuracy, performance reliability, and legal compliance — are the pillars of every AGSA audit. Understanding them is the first step to reading the reports.

:::takeaway
AGSA is a constitutionally independent institution that audits every organ of state that spends public money. It examines three things: whether the financial statements are accurate, whether reported performance is reliable, and whether the entity complied with the law. Its reports are the most systematic tool available for citizens to assess whether their government is managing public resources responsibly. Understanding AGSA's mandate — and its independence — is essential to using its findings effectively.

## The Five Audit Outcomes: A Vocabulary for Accountability

When AGSA completes an audit, it issues an audit opinion — a formal assessment of the entity's financial statements. There are five possible outcomes, ranging from the best (a clean audit) to the worst (a disclaimer of opinion). These five outcomes are the vocabulary of public financial accountability in South Africa, and understanding what each one means — and what it does not mean — is the most important skill this article teaches you.

### Clean Audit: The Gold Standard

A clean audit — formally called an "unqualified audit opinion with no findings" — means three things simultaneously. First, the entity's financial statements are free from material misstatements — the books are accurate and can be relied upon. Second, there are no material findings on the entity's reporting of its performance against predetermined objectives — the performance information is useful and reliable. Third, there are no material findings on non-compliance with applicable legislation — the entity followed the rules.

A clean audit is the gold standard because it means that all three dimensions — financial accuracy, performance reliability, and legal compliance — passed scrutiny. It does not mean the entity performed well in an absolute sense. A department can receive a clean audit and still have delivered mediocre services — the audit assesses whether the books are accurate and the rules were followed, not whether the policy choices were wise or the outcomes were sufficient. But a clean audit does mean that the basic machinery of financial management is working: the entity knows what it spent, can prove what it achieved, and did so within the law.

### Unqualified with Findings: Clean Books, Dirty Governance

An "unqualified audit opinion with findings" means that the financial statements themselves are materially correct — the books are clean — but AGSA found material problems in either the entity's performance information, its compliance with legislation, or both. This is the most common audit outcome across government, and it is the one that most citizens misunderstand.

The distinction matters. An entity with an unqualified opinion with findings has accurate financial records — you can trust the numbers in its annual financial statements. But it may have failed to follow procurement regulations, may have incurred irregular expenditure, may have reported performance information that was not supported by evidence, or may have failed to comply with other legislative requirements. The books are correct; the governance around those books is not.

This outcome captures a wide spectrum. At one end, it includes entities with minor compliance gaps — a procurement process that deviated slightly from the regulations but achieved fair value. At the other end, it includes entities with significant governance failures — large-scale irregular expenditure, unreliable performance data, systemic non-compliance — where the only thing that works properly is the accounting system. The audit opinion alone does not tell you where on this spectrum the entity falls. For that, you need to read the detailed findings in the audit report.

### Qualified Opinion: Material Problems in the Numbers

A qualified audit opinion means that the financial statements contain material misstatements in specific amounts or areas, or that AGSA could not obtain sufficient evidence to verify specific amounts. The key word is "specific" — the problems are confined to identifiable areas of the financial statements, not pervasive across the entire document.

A qualified opinion is a red flag. It means that the entity's financial records cannot be fully trusted — there are specific areas where the numbers are wrong, missing, or unverifiable. A provincial health department might receive a qualified opinion because it could not substantiate the value of its medical supplies inventory. A municipality might be qualified because it could not provide evidence for reported revenue from service charges. In each case, the financial statements as a whole are not necessarily unreliable, but specific components are materially misstated or unverifiable.

For citizens, a qualified opinion should prompt a specific question: qualified on what? The audit report will identify the exact areas of qualification. If your municipality is qualified on its property, plant, and equipment valuation, that tells you something different from a qualification on its revenue recognition. The nature of the qualification reveals where the financial management has broken down.

### Adverse Opinion: The Books Cannot Be Trusted

An adverse audit opinion means that the financial statements contain material misstatements that are not confined to specific amounts or areas — the misstatements are so pervasive that the financial statements as a whole do not fairly present the entity's financial position. In plain language: the books are fundamentally unreliable.

An adverse opinion is rare and severe. It means that you cannot trust the financial statements at all — not specific sections, not specific line items, but the entire document. An entity that receives an adverse opinion has financial management that has broken down at a systemic level. The accounting systems, internal controls, and financial reporting processes have failed to such a degree that the entity cannot produce an accurate account of what it received, what it spent, and what it owes.

### Disclaimer of Opinion: The Auditor Cannot Even Form a View

A disclaimer of opinion is the worst possible audit outcome. It means that AGSA could not obtain sufficient evidence to form any opinion at all on the financial statements. The entity's records were so incomplete, so disorganised, or so inaccessible that the auditor could not determine whether the financial statements were materially correct or materially misstated.

A disclaimer is not a finding about the quality of financial management — it is a finding about the absence of financial management. An entity that receives a disclaimer has failed to maintain the basic documentation that any audit requires: supporting records, transaction evidence, asset registers, reconciliations. The entity may have spent hundreds of millions of rand, but it cannot demonstrate how it spent the money, on what, or whether the amounts recorded in its financial statements bear any relationship to reality.

For citizens, a disclaimer should be treated as an emergency signal. It means that public money has been spent with no credible account of where it went. It does not necessarily mean the money was stolen — it may mean the systems were so dysfunctional that nobody can tell. But the practical effect is the same: accountability is impossible because the evidence base for accountability does not exist.

:::takeaway
The five audit outcomes — clean audit, unqualified with findings, qualified, adverse, and disclaimer — form a hierarchy from best to worst. A clean audit means the books are accurate, performance is reported reliably, and the law was followed. An unqualified with findings means accurate books but governance problems. A qualified opinion means specific parts of the books are wrong. An adverse opinion means the books as a whole cannot be trusted. A disclaimer means the auditor could not form any opinion at all. Learning to distinguish these outcomes is the foundation of reading any AGSA report.
:::

## Two Audit Systems: PFMA and MFMA

AGSA operates two parallel audit systems, governed by different legislation, with different timelines and different reporting structures. Understanding this distinction is essential because the audit outcomes for your provincial hospital and the audit outcomes for your municipality are released at different times, under different laws, and are reported in separate consolidated reports.

### The PFMA System: National and Provincial Government

The Public Finance Management Act 1 of 1999 (PFMA) governs the financial management of national and provincial departments, constitutional institutions, and public entities (including state-owned enterprises). All PFMA-regulated entities have a financial year that ends on 31 March. Accounting officers must submit their financial statements to the Auditor-General and National Treasury within two months of year-end — by 31 May. AGSA then has approximately three months to complete the audits.

The consolidated PFMA general report — which provides the overall picture of audit outcomes across all national and provincial departments and public entities — is typically tabled in Parliament around November. In the most recent cycle, AGSA tabled the 2023/24 PFMA general report on 26 November 2024.

The PFMA system covers a large universe of auditees. In the 2023/24 cycle, AGSA audited 417 entities under the PFMA framework. Of these, 144 (35%) achieved clean audits. Another 175 (42%) received unqualified opinions with findings. Sixty-seven (16%) were qualified, four received adverse opinions, and seven received disclaimers. Eighteen audits remained outstanding at the time of reporting.

The headline figure — that 77% of PFMA auditees received financially unqualified opinions (either clean or unqualified with findings) — suggests that the majority of national and provincial entities can at least produce accurate financial statements. But the Auditor-General's own analysis, using a framework called the "CultureShift Continuum," paints a less reassuring picture. AGSA assessed that only 9% of PFMA auditees were "doing good" across all dimensions, while 23% were "doing harm" — actively damaging public resources through poor governance and financial management. The largest group — 40% — was classified as "not doing the basics."

### The MFMA System: Local Government

The Municipal Finance Management Act 56 of 2003 (MFMA) governs the financial management of metropolitan, district, and local municipalities and their municipal entities. Municipalities operate on a different financial calendar: their financial year ends on 30 June. Financial statements must be submitted to AGSA within two months — by 31 August — and the consolidated MFMA general report is typically tabled the following year.

The municipal audit picture is substantially worse than the national and provincial picture. In the 2023/24 cycle, only 41 of 257 municipalities (16%) achieved clean audits. Ninety-nine (39%) received unqualified opinions with findings. Ninety (35%) were qualified. Six received adverse opinions, and 11 received disclaimers. Ten municipalities either did not submit their financial statements on time or their audits remained outstanding.

The municipal CultureShift assessment is striking: 45% of municipalities were classified as "doing harm," 43% as "not doing the basics," and only 1% as "doing good." The gap between the PFMA and MFMA audit outcomes reflects the capacity and governance challenges that this series has documented across multiple articles — the structural mismatch between what municipalities are expected to deliver and the institutional resources available to them.

The geographic distribution of clean audits reveals deep provincial disparities. The Western Cape accounted for 20 of the 41 municipal clean audits nationally — nearly half. The Free State has not produced a single clean municipal audit since 2016. These patterns are not random. They reflect long-standing differences in provincial oversight, institutional stability, and governance culture that the audit results quantify but cannot, on their own, resolve.

:::expert
The Auditor-General's consolidated reports provide not only audit outcomes but also a diagnostic framework for understanding why those outcomes occur. AGSA's analysis consistently identifies three "key controls" that predict audit outcomes: leadership, financial and performance management, and governance. Where all three controls are assessed as functioning effectively, the entity almost always receives a clean or unqualified audit. Where one or more controls have broken down, the audit outcomes deteriorate predictably. AGSA's data shows that the root cause most frequently associated with poor audit outcomes is leadership instability — vacancies in the positions of accounting officer, chief financial officer, or head of internal audit. A municipality that has had three different municipal managers in five years, or a provincial department that has operated with an acting CFO for two years, is statistically far more likely to receive a qualified, adverse, or disclaimed audit than one with stable, competent leadership. The implication for citizens is significant: when your municipality appoints an acting municipal manager for the third time in as many years, the audit outcome two years later is, to a large extent, already determined. Leadership stability is not a bureaucratic nicety — it is a prerequisite for financial accountability.
:::

## The Language of Financial Failure: Key Terms You Need to Know

AGSA's reports use a specific vocabulary to describe financial management failures. These terms appear in every audit report, every parliamentary debate about government performance, and every media headline about fiscal mismanagement. Understanding them precisely — rather than treating them as interchangeable synonyms for "corruption" — is essential to reading the reports accurately.

### Irregular Expenditure

Irregular expenditure is expenditure incurred in contravention of applicable legislation — primarily the PFMA for national and provincial entities and the MFMA for municipalities. The critical point is that irregular expenditure does not necessarily mean the money was stolen or wasted. It means the money was spent in a way that did not comply with the rules.

The most common cause of irregular expenditure is non-compliance with supply chain management regulations — procurement procedures were not followed correctly. A municipality that awarded a R10 million contract without inviting competitive bids, as required by law, has incurred R10 million in irregular expenditure. The contract may have been awarded to a competent company at a fair price, delivering excellent work — or it may have been awarded to a politically connected company at an inflated price. The irregular expenditure classification tells you that the rules were broken. It does not tell you whether the outcome was harmful. For that, you need further investigation.

The scale of irregular expenditure is enormous. In the 2022/23 financial year alone, AGSA reported irregular expenditure of R53.55 billion across local government. National and provincial departments added further tens of billions. The cumulative total of unresolved irregular expenditure — expenditure that has been flagged but never fully investigated, condoned, or recovered — runs into the hundreds of billions. This accumulated backlog represents one of the most significant accountability failures in South Africa's public financial management system.

### Fruitless and Wasteful Expenditure

Fruitless and wasteful expenditure is expenditure that was made in vain and that could have been avoided had reasonable care been exercised. Common examples include interest and penalties on late payments to creditors, payments for goods or services not received, double payments, and penalties for contract cancellations. Unlike irregular expenditure, which is about process, fruitless and wasteful expenditure is about outcome — the money was definitively wasted.

### Unauthorized Expenditure

Unauthorized expenditure occurs when an entity spends more than Parliament (or a municipal council) approved for a particular vote or programme, or spends approved money on a purpose different from what was authorised. If Parliament appropriated R5 billion for a department and the department spent R5.3 billion, the excess R300 million is unauthorized expenditure — regardless of what it was spent on or whether the spending was beneficial. If a department used money appropriated for personnel costs to pay for office renovations, the renovation expenditure is unauthorized — even if the offices needed renovation — because it was spent on a purpose Parliament did not approve.

### Material Misstatement

A material misstatement is incorrect or incomplete information in the financial statements that is significant enough to influence the decisions of users of those statements. AGSA determines materiality thresholds for each entity — the point at which an error becomes significant enough to affect the reliability of the financial statements as a whole. A R100,000 error in the financial statements of a national department with a R50 billion budget is not material. The same error in a small municipality with a R200 million budget may be.

Understanding these terms allows you to read AGSA's findings with precision. When a headline screams "R50 billion in irregular expenditure!" you can ask: was the expenditure irregular because of technical procurement failures, or because of deliberate corruption? When a department reports fruitless and wasteful expenditure of R200 million, you can ask: what reasonable care would have prevented it? The terminology is not designed to obscure — it is designed to be precise. Using it accurately gives you a clearer picture of what went wrong than any political speech or media headline can provide.

## The Expanded Mandate: Material Irregularities and the Power to Act

For most of its existence, AGSA had the power to audit and report — but not the power to act. The Auditor-General could identify financial mismanagement, quantify the losses, name the responsible officials, and publish the findings in painstaking detail. But the responsibility for doing something about those findings rested with other institutions: Parliament, SCOPA, law enforcement, the executive. Year after year, AGSA reported the same problems at the same entities. Year after year, the problems persisted.

In 2018, Parliament passed the Public Audit Amendment Act, which came into effect on 1 April 2019. The amendment gave AGSA expanded powers that fundamentally changed its role from a passive reporter to an active enforcer. The centrepiece of the expanded mandate is the **material irregularity (MI) process**.

### What Is a Material Irregularity?

A material irregularity is any non-compliance with legislation, fraud, theft, or breach of fiduciary duty identified during an audit that resulted in or is likely to result in a material financial loss, the misuse or loss of a material public resource, or substantial harm to a public sector institution or the general public. The definition is deliberately broad — it captures not only financial losses already incurred but losses that are likely to occur if the irregularity is not addressed.

### The MI Process: From Identification to Enforcement

When AGSA identifies a material irregularity during an audit, it triggers a structured enforcement process:

1. **Notification** — AGSA notifies the accounting officer or authority in writing, describing the irregularity and its financial impact.

2. **Response** — The accounting officer has 20 working days to respond in writing, providing evidence of actions taken or planned to address the irregularity.

3. **Recommendations** — If the response is inadequate, AGSA may include recommendations in the audit report with specific deadlines for remedial action.

4. **Remedial action** — If recommendations are not implemented, AGSA can issue binding remedial actions — legally enforceable directives that the accounting officer must comply with.

5. **Referral** — AGSA may refer material irregularities involving suspected fraud or criminal conduct to investigative bodies such as the Special Investigating Unit (SIU), the Hawks, or the South African Police Service.

6. **Certificate of debt** — The ultimate enforcement mechanism. If the accounting officer fails to implement remedial action, including recovering financial losses, AGSA must issue a certificate of debt requiring the accounting officer to personally repay the amount to the State.

### The First Certificate of Debt

On 14 November 2025, Auditor-General Tsakani Maluleke issued the first-ever certificate of debt since the expanded powers came into effect. It was issued against the municipal manager of Ngaka Modiri Molema District Municipality in North West province for R4,616,074.66 — plus interest — related to overpayment for water tankering services. The significance extends beyond the amount. The certificate of debt establishes that AGSA's expanded powers are not theoretical — they have real financial consequences for accounting officers who fail to address material irregularities.

Since the expanded mandate took effect, the results have been substantial. By the 2023/24 reporting period, AGSA had identified 626 material irregularities involving non-compliance and suspected fraud across national, provincial, and local government. Through the MI process, AGSA reported that it was responsible for the recovery and prevention of R3.47 billion in financial losses. These are not audit findings that sit in a report gathering dust. They are findings with enforcement mechanisms that compel action — or impose personal financial liability on the officials who refuse to act.

:::takeaway
The 2019 expanded mandate transformed AGSA from a watchdog that could bark but not bite into an institution with real enforcement powers. The material irregularity process gives AGSA the ability to identify irregularities, demand responses, issue binding remedial actions, refer cases for investigation, and — as a last resort — issue certificates of debt that make accounting officers personally liable. The first certificate of debt, issued in 2025, demonstrated that these powers are not symbolic. For citizens, the expanded mandate means that AGSA's findings now carry consequences that extend beyond reporting to enforcement.
:::

## SCOPA: Where Audit Reports Meet Political Accountability

AGSA's reports do not enforce themselves. The primary institution responsible for acting on audit findings at the national level is the Standing Committee on Public Accounts (SCOPA) — a standing committee of the National Assembly that serves as Parliament's watchdog over executive spending.

SCOPA's mandate is to consider the financial statements of all government departments and state institutions, examine the Auditor-General's reports on those statements, and call accounting officers to account for their expenditure. When the Auditor-General reports that a national department incurred R2 billion in irregular expenditure, it is SCOPA that summons the director-general to explain. When AGSA identifies material irregularities at a public entity, it is SCOPA that demands a remediation plan with deadlines.

Each of South Africa's nine provincial legislatures has its own equivalent committee — a provincial standing committee on public accounts — with the same mandate at the provincial level. These committees consider the audit reports for provincial departments and provincial public entities, holding provincial accounting officers to account for their use of equitable share and conditional grant funding.

The effectiveness of SCOPA and its provincial equivalents varies significantly. At the national level, SCOPA has a reputation as one of Parliament's more functional committees — it operates with a degree of multiparty cooperation, and its public hearings can be rigorous. The Parliamentary Monitoring Group (PMG) documents SCOPA proceedings in detail, making them accessible to citizens who want to follow up on audit findings. But even the most effective SCOPA hearing is limited by two structural constraints.

First, the volume is overwhelming. SCOPA must consider audit findings for hundreds of entities every year. The time available for hearings is finite, and many entities with poor audit outcomes never appear before the committee simply because there are too many entities and too few hearing days.

Second, SCOPA can recommend but cannot compel. It can demand explanations, set deadlines, and escalate matters to the full National Assembly. But it cannot fire an accounting officer, cannot recover misappropriated funds, and cannot impose penalties. The power to act on SCOPA's recommendations rests with the executive — the same executive whose officials are the subject of the findings. This creates a structural tension that limits the committee's effectiveness: the watchdog identifies the problem, but the entity responsible for fixing it is often the entity that caused it.

At the provincial level, the picture is more uneven. Some provincial public accounts committees are active and hold regular hearings. Others are understaffed, under-resourced, or politically captured — unable or unwilling to hold their own provincial executives to account. The quality of provincial oversight correlates strongly with audit outcomes: provinces where the public accounts committee is active and demanding tend to have better audit results than provinces where the committee is dormant.

## Reading a Report: What to Look for and Where to Find It

AGSA's consolidated general reports — the PFMA report and the MFMA report — are the two most important documents for any citizen who wants to assess government financial management at scale. They are published on AGSA's dedicated reports portal at [agsareports.co.za](https://www.agsareports.co.za), which hosts interactive online versions alongside downloadable documents. Individual audit reports for specific departments or municipalities are available on the main AGSA website at [agsa.co.za](https://www.agsa.co.za) under the Reporting tab.

Here is how to read them.

### Start with the Audit Outcomes Overview

Every consolidated general report opens with a summary of audit outcomes across all entities audited. This is the dashboard: it tells you how many entities received each type of audit opinion, how the results compare to the previous year, and which direction the trends are moving. Look for two things: the overall distribution of outcomes (are more entities achieving clean audits or are more regressing?) and the movement between categories (how many entities improved their audit outcome compared to last year, and how many regressed?).

### Check the Key Controls Assessment

AGSA assesses three key control areas for every entity: leadership, financial and performance management, and governance. The key controls assessment tells you not just what the audit outcome was, but why. An entity with good leadership and poor financial management has a different problem — and requires a different intervention — than an entity with poor leadership and reasonable systems. The key controls section of the report identifies where the failures are concentrated and what needs to change for outcomes to improve.

### Read the Compliance Findings

The compliance section of the report details the most common areas of non-compliance across all audited entities. Supply chain management findings — failures to follow procurement regulations — are consistently the most prevalent. Other common compliance areas include expenditure management (overspending, unauthorized expenditure), revenue management (uncollected revenue, poor billing), and asset management (assets not recorded, assets not verified). The compliance findings tell you which rules are being broken most frequently and where the system's governance weaknesses are concentrated.

### Examine the Material Irregularities

Since the expanded mandate came into effect, the material irregularities section has become one of the most important parts of the report. It lists the MIs identified, their estimated financial impact, the status of each MI (whether the accounting officer has responded, whether recommendations have been implemented, whether referrals have been made), and any certificates of debt issued. This section tells you where AGSA has identified not just audit findings but actionable irregularities with real financial consequences.

### Look at the Financial Health Analysis

The financial health section assesses whether entities are financially sustainable — whether they can pay their debts, whether their revenue is sufficient to cover their expenditure, and whether they are heading toward financial distress. For municipalities, this section is particularly important: it identifies which municipalities are operating with unfunded budgets (spending plans that exceed available revenue), which have unrecoverable debt, and which are at risk of financial collapse. In the 2023/24 cycle, over 100 municipalities were identified as operating with unfunded budgets, and 76% of municipal debt was assessed as not recoverable.

### Compare Across Years

AGSA's reports include trend data — typically five years of audit outcomes for each entity. This is where the real story emerges. A municipality that has regressed from a clean audit to a qualified opinion over three years is on a downward trajectory that demands attention. A department that has improved from a disclaimer to a qualified opinion is making progress — slow progress, but progress. The trend matters more than any single year's result because it reveals direction.

## The Water Crisis: A Case Study in Reading the Numbers

To make these concepts concrete, consider AGSA's recent audit of the water and sanitation sector — a thematic report that illustrates exactly what citizens can learn from reading the Auditor-General's findings.

AGSA's analysis found that 46% of municipalities had unsafe drinking water systems, with 44% failing chemical safety standards. Ninety-nine percent of wastewater treatment plants failed at least one quality standard. Water losses — water that entered the system but was never billed or consumed — amounted to R14.89 billion in the 2023/24 financial year. Material irregularities totalling over R1.7 billion were identified across national and local entities in the water sector. Average infrastructure project delays were 32 months.

These are not abstract numbers. They tell you that if you live in a municipality where the water tastes different every other week, or where your street floods with sewage after heavy rain, or where you have been waiting three years for a water connection that was supposed to take six months — the Auditor-General has already documented the systemic failure that explains your experience. The data exists. The diagnosis is specific. The responsible officials have been identified.

Since 2019, AGSA has issued 56 material irregularities specifically related to pollution caused by failing wastewater treatment works. By January 2025, 70% of those material irregularities remained unresolved. More than one-third of Water Services Authorities — particularly in the Free State and Northern Cape — either lacked water service development plans or had not updated them in five years.

This is what reading AGSA reports gives you: not just the knowledge that "water services are bad" — which you already know from your daily experience — but the precise diagnosis of why they are bad, which specific regulations are being violated, which officials are responsible, what financial losses have been quantified, and what enforcement actions are underway. That precision transforms a complaint into an accountability claim.

:::expert
AGSA has increasingly adopted thematic and sector-specific auditing alongside its standard financial audits, recognising that the most serious service delivery failures often span multiple entities and governance levels. The water and sanitation sector audit exemplifies this approach: rather than examining individual municipal audits in isolation, AGSA traced the entire water value chain from national policy through provincial oversight to municipal delivery, identifying systemic breakdowns at each level. This approach reveals patterns that entity-by-entity auditing cannot — the fact that a municipality's failing wastewater treatment plant is not an isolated management failure but part of a national pattern affecting 99% of plants, driven by decades of underinvestment, skills shortages, and inadequate regulatory enforcement. For citizens, thematic audits are particularly valuable because they answer the question "is this just my municipality, or is this a systemic problem?" — a question that determines whether the solution lies in local accountability or national policy reform. AGSA's thematic reports are published alongside the consolidated general reports and are accessible on the AGSA website under special audit reports.

PFMA reports cover national and provincial departments — look under PFMA Reports. MFMA reports cover municipalities — look under MFMA Reports. Identify your province's departments (especially health and education, which consume approximately 80% of provincial budgets) and your municipality.

**Step 2: Check the audit opinion**

Start with the audit outcome. Is it a clean audit, unqualified with findings, qualified, adverse, or disclaimer? Compare it to the previous year. Has it improved, stayed the same, or regressed? A regression from unqualified with findings to qualified is a warning signal. A persistent disclaimer over multiple years is an accountability emergency.

**Step 3: Read the compliance findings**

Look specifically at supply chain management findings — these indicate whether procurement was conducted fairly and lawfully. Check for irregular expenditure (how much, and is it increasing?), unauthorized expenditure (did the entity overspend its approved budget?), and fruitless and wasteful expenditure (was money definitively wasted?). Note whether the entity has a plan to address prior-year irregular expenditure or whether it is accumulating unresolved backlogs.

**Step 4: Check the material irregularities**

If material irregularities have been identified, the report will describe them, estimate the financial impact, and report on the status of remedial actions. Are the responsible officials taking action? Has AGSA escalated to binding remedial actions or referrals to law enforcement? This section tells you whether the system is self-correcting or whether the same problems are persisting without consequence.

**Step 5: Compare allocation to outcomes**

Cross-reference the audit findings with the budget allocation data from National Treasury's Division of Revenue documents at [treasury.gov.za](https://www.treasury.gov.za). If your municipality received R150 million in infrastructure grants and the Auditor-General reports significant underspending, irregular expenditure, and project delays — the picture is clear. The money was available; the institutional capacity to spend it properly was not.

**Step 6: Follow up through SCOPA**

SCOPA hearings and parliamentary committee meetings are documented by the Parliamentary Monitoring Group at [pmg.org.za](https://pmg.org.za). Search for your department or municipality to see whether SCOPA has held hearings on the audit findings, what commitments were made by accounting officers, and whether those commitments have been honoured. Provincial public accounts committee proceedings may be available through your provincial legislature's website.

**Where to find the data:**

AGSA consolidated general reports and individual entity reports: [agsa.co.za](https://www.agsa.co.za) and [agsareports.co.za](https://www.agsareports.co.za). National Treasury budget documents and Division of Revenue data: [treasury.gov.za](https://www.treasury.gov.za). Municipal financial data: [municipaldata.treasury.gov.za](https://municipaldata.treasury.gov.za). SCOPA and parliamentary committee proceedings: [pmg.org.za](https://pmg.org.za). AGSA also publishes a Citizen's Report — an accessible summary designed for the general public — available on its website alongside each consolidated general report.

## Where to Go From Here

You now understand what the Auditor-General of South Africa is, what it audits, how its five audit opinions work, what the key financial management terms mean, how the expanded material irregularity mandate operates, and how to access and read the reports yourself. You understand the difference between PFMA and MFMA audits, you know what SCOPA does with audit findings, and you have a practical toolkit for turning published audit data into accountability claims.

In *Using Government Data*, the next article in this series, we will broaden the lens from AGSA to the full landscape of public data that citizens can use — from National Treasury's fiscal data to Statistics South Africa's survey data to the performance information that departments publish under the Government Wide Monitoring and Evaluation System. In *Becoming an Active Citizen*, the final article, we will bring everything together: the architecture, the money, the participation rights, and the accountability tools — into a framework for sustained civic engagement that goes beyond a single election, a single audit report, or a single public submission.

The Auditor-General's reports are not written for accountants. They are written for you — the citizen whose money was collected, allocated, and spent. The reports tell you whether that money was managed responsibly. The expanded mandate ensures that when it was not, there are consequences. The only missing ingredient is citizens who read the reports, understand the findings, and use them to demand accountability. That ingredient is you.
