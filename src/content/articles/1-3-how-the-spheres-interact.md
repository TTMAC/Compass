## The System That Holds the System Together

In the first two articles of this series, you learned the architecture of the South African state — three constitutionally equal spheres, each with protected powers — and you mapped out which sphere is responsible for which services. That knowledge is essential. But it is incomplete without understanding the connective tissue: the formal and informal mechanisms through which the three spheres are supposed to coordinate, cooperate, resolve disputes, and — when cooperation fails entirely — intervene in each other's affairs.

Here is the bottom line, stated upfront: **South Africa has one of the most elaborate intergovernmental relations frameworks in the developing world, but the gap between the framework on paper and its functioning in practice is vast.** The Constitution mandates cooperation. The Intergovernmental Relations Framework Act of 2005 creates the forums. The Budget Council and MinMECs meet regularly. Provincial premiers sit on the President's Coordinating Council. And yet, the coordination that these mechanisms are supposed to produce — alignment between national policy, provincial implementation, and municipal delivery — frequently does not happen. The machinery exists. What is often missing is the political will, the institutional capacity, and the trust between spheres that the cooperative governance model assumes.

This matters directly to you because when the spheres fail to coordinate, services fail. A housing project stalls because the province has approved the development but the municipality has not provided bulk infrastructure. A water crisis deepens because the national water board, the provincial health department, and the municipality cannot agree on emergency protocols. A school feeding programme runs out of food in the third term because the conditional grant disbursement from national to provincial was delayed and nobody escalated the problem through the intergovernmental system. These are not hypothetical examples. They are the routine consequences of a cooperative governance system that cooperates less than its design requires.

## The Constitutional Foundation: What Chapter 3 Demands

Chapter 3 of the Constitution — titled "Co-operative Government" — is the legal foundation for how the spheres relate to each other. Section 40(1) establishes the three spheres as "distinctive, interdependent and interrelated." Those three adjectives are not decorative. Each carries specific constitutional meaning.

"Distinctive" means each sphere has its own identity, its own democratic mandate, and its own constitutionally protected powers. National government cannot simply absorb a provincial function because it thinks it could do it better. A province cannot take over a municipal function on a whim. The distinctiveness of each sphere is protected by the Constitution's allocation of powers in Schedules 4 and 5.

"Interdependent" means the spheres rely on each other. National government cannot deliver health policy without provinces running the hospitals. Provinces cannot run hospitals without municipalities providing water, electricity, and sanitation to those hospitals. Municipalities cannot provide bulk infrastructure without national funding through the Division of Revenue Act. No sphere is self-sufficient. The governance architecture is designed so that each sphere needs the others to function.

"Interrelated" means the spheres' functions overlap and connect. Education is a concurrent function where national sets the curriculum and provinces manage the schools. Housing requires national funding, provincial project management, and municipal land and infrastructure. Water involves national bulk supply, municipal reticulation, and provincial health oversight. The interrelation of functions means that single-sphere solutions to multi-sphere problems are structurally impossible.

Section 41 then sets out the principles that must govern the relationship between spheres. All spheres and all organs of state must preserve the peace, the national unity, and the indivisibility of the Republic. They must secure the well-being of the people. They must provide effective, transparent, accountable, and coherent government. They must co-operate with one another in mutual trust and good faith by fostering friendly relations, assisting and supporting one another, informing one another of matters of common interest, coordinating their actions and legislation, adhering to agreed procedures, and avoiding legal proceedings against one another.

That last principle — avoiding legal proceedings — is particularly significant. Section 41(3) requires that an organ of state involved in an intergovernmental dispute must make every reasonable effort to settle the dispute through intergovernmental mechanisms before approaching a court. This reflects the framers' intention that the cooperative governance system should be self-regulating, with courts as a last resort rather than a first response.

:::takeaway
The Constitution does not merely permit cooperation between spheres — it mandates it. Section 41 requires all spheres to cooperate in mutual trust and good faith, to coordinate their actions, and to exhaust intergovernmental dispute resolution mechanisms before turning to litigation. The cooperative governance model is not optional. It is a constitutional obligation that every official in every sphere is bound by, and failure to cooperate is itself a constitutional violation.

## The Intergovernmental Relations Framework Act: The Operating Manual

The Constitution establishes the principle of cooperative governance. The Intergovernmental Relations Framework Act (IGRFA) of 2005 creates the practical machinery for implementing it. The IGRFA is the operating manual for how the three spheres coordinate — who meets whom, how often, with what mandate, and through what structures.

The IGRFA establishes a hierarchy of intergovernmental forums, from the apex structures where the president meets premiers, down to district-level forums where district and local municipalities coordinate. Each forum has a defined membership, a defined purpose, and — in theory — a defined relationship to the forums above and below it.

### The President's Coordinating Council

At the apex sits the President's Coordinating Council (PCC), chaired by the president and comprising the deputy president, ministers designated by the president, the nine provincial premiers, and the chairperson of the South African Local Government Association (SALGA). The PCC is the most senior intergovernmental forum in the country. It is supposed to deal with matters that affect the national interest and that require the coordination of all three spheres — major policy shifts, national emergencies, systemic governance failures.

The PCC meets at least twice a year. In practice, its meetings tend to be formal affairs where prepared positions are presented rather than genuine negotiations conducted. The power asymmetry is significant: the president chairs the meeting, and the national government's fiscal dominance — collecting approximately 93% of all tax revenue — gives it leverage that no constitutional principle of equality can fully counterbalance. Premiers, particularly those from the same political party as the president, are reluctant to challenge national positions in this forum. The PCC functions more as a coordination briefing than as a deliberative body where provincial interests genuinely shape national decisions.

### MinMECs: Where Policy Meets Implementation

The most operationally significant intergovernmental forums are the MinMECs — meetings between a national minister and the nine provincial Members of the Executive Council (MECs) responsible for the same functional area. There is a MinMEC for health, for education, for human settlements, for finance, for agriculture, for cooperative governance, and for each other concurrent function.

MinMECs are where national policy is supposed to meet provincial implementation reality. When the national Minister of Basic Education introduces a new curriculum requirement, the education MinMEC is where provincial education MECs raise implementation concerns — we do not have enough trained teachers, our rural schools lack the infrastructure, the timeline is unrealistic. When the national Minister of Health announces a new treatment protocol, the health MinMEC is where provincial health MECs discuss the funding, staffing, and supply chain implications.

In theory, MinMECs produce coordinated implementation plans that align national policy with provincial capacity. In practice, the quality and effectiveness of MinMECs varies enormously across sectors. The finance MinMEC — chaired by the national Minister of Finance and attended by provincial finance MECs — is widely regarded as the most effective, largely because the Budget Council (which has a similar composition) has real fiscal decisions to make and the National Treasury has the institutional capacity to drive coordination. The health and education MinMECs function reasonably well in terms of information sharing but less well in terms of genuine coordination — provinces attend, receive briefings, and then implement according to their own capacity and priorities.

Several structural factors undermine MinMEC effectiveness. First, attendance is inconsistent. MECs sometimes delegate to HODs or deputy directors-general, which means the person at the table lacks the political authority to make commitments. Second, MinMECs are advisory, not decision-making bodies. They can recommend and coordinate, but they cannot compel any sphere to act. Third, the frequency of meetings — typically quarterly — does not match the tempo of service delivery challenges. A quarterly MinMEC cannot address a daily operational crisis.

:::expert
Research by the Public Affairs Research Institute (PARI) on intergovernmental coordination mechanisms has identified a consistent pattern in MinMEC proceedings across multiple sectors. PARI's fieldwork observing intergovernmental forums reveals a recurring cycle: the national minister presents the agenda, provincial MECs make statements, discussion occurs, and action items are recorded — but when participants return to their respective spheres, the coordination commitments frequently evaporate. The fundamental problem, PARI's researchers argue, is structural rather than personal: when a MinMEC agrees that all provinces will implement a particular intervention by a particular date and several provinces fail to do so, the MinMEC has no enforcement mechanism. It cannot withhold funding. It cannot impose sanctions. The next meeting simply notes the non-compliance and expresses concern. This cycle of agreement, non-compliance, and concern — documented by PARI across health, education, and human settlements MinMECs — is the defining pattern of South Africa's intergovernmental relations and the most significant structural limitation of the IGRFA framework.
:::

### The Forum of South African Directors-General

Below the political level, the Forum of South African Directors-General (FOSAD) brings together national and provincial directors-general — the administrative heads of departments — to coordinate implementation. FOSAD operates through a plenary (all directors-general) and a management committee, with technical clusters that mirror the government's cluster system (governance and administration, economic sectors, social, justice and security, and international cooperation).

FOSAD is supposed to be where the administrative machinery of government coordinates across spheres — aligning implementation plans, resolving operational bottlenecks, sharing best practices. In practice, FOSAD suffers from many of the same weaknesses as the political forums. Directors-general are overstretched, attendance is uneven, and the forum's advisory nature limits its ability to drive coordination. The high turnover of directors-general — a consequence of the instability of senior public service appointments — further undermines FOSAD's effectiveness, as institutional memory and relationships are repeatedly disrupted.

### Provincial Intergovernmental Forums

Each province has a Premier's Intergovernmental Forum, chaired by the premier and comprising the provincial MECs, district mayors, metropolitan mayors (where applicable), and the provincial SALGA representative. This forum coordinates between the provincial government and municipalities within the province. Below this, each district has a District Intergovernmental Forum, chaired by the district mayor and comprising local mayors within the district and relevant provincial and national officials.

These provincial and district forums are critical because they are where provincial and municipal functions intersect — housing delivery, water provision, health services, transport planning. A district intergovernmental forum is where the district municipality, local municipalities, and provincial departments are supposed to align their infrastructure plans, coordinate their budgets, and resolve service delivery problems.

The reality, documented in multiple studies including research by the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (COGTA), is that many of these lower-level forums are dysfunctional. They meet irregularly if at all. Attendance is poor. The forums lack dedicated secretariat support to prepare agendas, circulate documents, and track decisions. When they do meet, the discussions tend to be dominated by information sharing rather than genuine problem-solving. The result is a coordination gap at precisely the level where coordination matters most — between the province that funds services and the municipalities that deliver them.

## The Budget Council and Fiscal Coordination

The most consequential intergovernmental coordination happens through the fiscal system, because money is the most effective coordination mechanism the state has. The Budget Council — comprising the national Minister of Finance and the nine provincial finance MECs — is the forum where the annual Division of Revenue Act is negotiated. The Budget Forum extends this to include SALGA, bringing the municipal sphere into fiscal discussions.

The Financial and Fiscal Commission (FFC), an independent constitutional body established under Section 220, advises the Budget Council on the division of revenue between spheres. The FFC's recommendations are not binding, but they carry significant weight and must be formally tabled in Parliament alongside the Division of Revenue Bill.

The fiscal coordination process works reasonably well — better, in fact, than coordination in most other policy areas. There are several reasons for this. First, the National Treasury has strong institutional capacity and exercises significant influence over provincial and municipal financial management through the Public Finance Management Act (for national and provincial departments) and the Municipal Finance Management Act (for municipalities). Second, money concentrates minds: the annual budget process creates a hard deadline around which coordination must occur. Third, the conditional grant system — whatever its limitations — provides a mechanism for national government to direct provincial and municipal spending toward national priorities.

But fiscal coordination also has significant blind spots. The equitable share — the unconditional transfer that accounts for the bulk of provincial revenue — comes with no spending conditions. National Treasury transfers the money and has limited ability to influence how provinces spend it. A province can receive an equitable share allocation that assumes a certain level of health and education spending, but if the province chooses to overspend on administration and underspend on frontline services, the fiscal coordination mechanisms cannot prevent this. The Auditor-General can report on it after the fact, but the intergovernmental fiscal system lacks real-time corrective mechanisms.

:::takeaway
South Africa's intergovernmental relations framework creates a hierarchy of forums — from the President's Coordinating Council down to district intergovernmental forums — designed to coordinate policy and service delivery across spheres. The fiscal coordination mechanisms, anchored by the Budget Council and National Treasury, function better than most other coordination structures because money creates hard deadlines and Treasury has institutional capacity. But the broader intergovernmental system suffers from a fundamental weakness: forums are advisory, not decision-making. They can coordinate but not compel, recommend but not enforce. When spheres choose not to cooperate, the system has limited tools to force the issue.

## The National Council of Provinces: The Legislative Bridge

The National Council of Provinces (NCOP) occupies a unique position in the intergovernmental system. It is not an executive coordination mechanism like a MinMEC or the Budget Council. It is a legislative body — the second house of Parliament — specifically designed to ensure that provincial interests are represented in national lawmaking.

Section 42(4) of the Constitution states that the NCOP "represents the provinces to ensure that provincial interests are taken into account in the national sphere of government." Every piece of legislation that affects provinces — and most legislation does — must pass through the NCOP. For legislation falling under Schedule 4 (concurrent functions), the NCOP's process is particularly significant: each province's ten-member delegation votes as a bloc, with the provincial legislature's mandate determining the vote. This "one province, one vote" system on Section 76 bills means that a province's interests, at least in theory, carry real weight in the legislative process.

The NCOP also conducts oversight of the executive through questions to ministers, debates on policy matters, and its committees. The Select Committees of the NCOP mirror the portfolio committees of the National Assembly but with a provincial lens. The NCOP's "Taking Parliament to the People" programme, in which the NCOP holds sessions in different provinces to hear public submissions, is designed to connect the institution to the communities it serves.

In practice, the NCOP has been the most disappointing element of the cooperative governance architecture. For most of the post-1994 period, party discipline has overwhelmed provincial interest representation. When one political party controlled the national government and most provincial governments simultaneously, NCOP delegates voted along party lines rather than advocating for their provinces' distinct needs. A study by the Parliamentary Monitoring Group found that the NCOP's Section 76 process often operates on compressed timelines that give provincial legislatures inadequate time to formulate mandates, reducing the provincial representation function to a formality.

The coalition era that began after the 2024 elections has created new dynamics. With no single party commanding a majority in the NCOP, votes are no longer foregone conclusions. Provincial delegations now have genuine leverage, and the negotiation that the Constitution's framers envisioned — national government having to earn provincial support for legislation — is beginning to emerge. Whether this represents a permanent evolution in the NCOP's functioning or a temporary consequence of a particular electoral outcome remains to be seen.

## When Cooperation Fails: Section 100 and Section 139 Interventions

The Constitution's framers understood that cooperative governance would sometimes break down. They therefore included intervention mechanisms — extraordinary powers that allow one sphere to step into another when it is failing to meet its constitutional obligations. These mechanisms are the governance system's emergency brakes, and understanding how they work (and how often they fail) is essential for any citizen trying to hold government accountable.

### Section 100: National Intervention in Provincial Government

Section 100 allows the national executive to intervene in a province when the province "cannot or does not fulfil an executive obligation in terms of the Constitution or legislation." The intervention comes in two forms. Section 100(1)(a) allows the national executive to issue a directive to the provincial executive describing the extent of the failure and the steps required to fix it. Section 100(1)(b) — the more severe form — allows the national executive to assume responsibility for the relevant obligation, effectively taking over a provincial function.

A Section 100(1)(b) intervention must be approved by the NCOP within 30 days, reviewed regularly, and terminated as soon as the province is able to resume the function. The intervention is supposed to be temporary, targeted, and aimed at restoring the province's capacity rather than permanently nationalising a provincial function.

The most extensive use of Section 100 was the 2011 intervention in the Limpopo provincial administration. The national government placed five Limpopo provincial departments — Education, Health, Public Works, Provincial Treasury, and Roads and Transport — under national administration. The intervention was triggered by a cascade of failures: the Limpopo education department's failure to deliver textbooks to schools (a crisis that became the subject of constitutional litigation), a provincial health department in financial crisis, and a provincial treasury unable to control spending.

The Limpopo intervention produced mixed results. It stabilised some acute crises — textbooks were eventually delivered, and some financial controls were restored. But a comprehensive assessment by the Public Affairs Research Institute (PARI) found that the intervention did not address the underlying institutional weaknesses. National administrators brought in to manage provincial departments were themselves sometimes associated with irregular practices. When the intervention ended, many of the same dysfunctional patterns re-emerged. The intervention treated symptoms rather than causes.

:::expert
Dr Vinothan Naidoo's research on provincial governance reform, published in *Politikon* (2009) and in the Springer *Handbook of Federal Countries* (2020), identifies a fundamental paradox in Section 100 interventions. The constitutional logic assumes that the intervening sphere — national government — possesses the capacity and competence to fix the failing sphere. But Naidoo's analysis of provincial governance demonstrates that national departments tasked with stabilising provincial departments are themselves frequently constrained by capacity shortfalls, vacancy rates, and governance challenges. A department with a qualified audit opinion may be assigned to rehabilitate a department with a disclaimer — an asymmetry of competence that the intervention framework assumes but that the evidence does not consistently support. Naidoo's comparative analysis of provincial performance suggests that the binary assumption underlying the intervention power — that national equals competent and provincial equals incompetent — does not hold across the board, and that the capacity to exercise intervention power effectively is often absent in the intervening sphere itself.
:::

### Section 139: Provincial Intervention in Municipal Government

Section 139 is the more frequently used intervention power, allowing provincial government to intervene in a municipality when it cannot or does not fulfil its executive obligations. Section 139 provides a graduated set of tools.

Section 139(1)(a) allows the provincial executive to issue a directive to the municipal council describing the extent of the failure and the steps required to remedy it. This is the lightest touch — essentially a formal warning with specific instructions.

Section 139(1)(b) allows the provincial executive to assume responsibility for the relevant obligation. This means the province takes over a municipal function — typically financial management — while the elected council remains in place. The province appoints an administrator who exercises the relevant powers concurrently with or in place of the municipal council.

Section 139(1)(c) is the most drastic measure: the provincial executive can dissolve the municipal council entirely and appoint an administrator to govern the municipality until a new council is elected. This nuclear option effectively suspends local democracy and places the municipality under appointed management.

There are also fiscal interventions under Section 139(4) and (5), which allow provincial intervention specifically when a municipality is in financial crisis — unable to meet its financial commitments or failing to approve a budget.

South Africa has accumulated extensive experience with Section 139 interventions. Between 1998 and 2023, over 60 municipalities were subjected to some form of provincial intervention, according to data compiled by COGTA. The track record is, to be blunt, poor. A systematic analysis by PARI of Section 139 interventions found that the majority failed to achieve their stated objectives. Several patterns recur.

First, interventions are frequently politically motivated rather than technically justified. A provincial government controlled by one party intervenes in a municipality controlled by a rival party, using Section 139 as a political weapon rather than a governance tool. The intervention in the Tlokwe Local Municipality (now JB Marks) in the North West Province in 2014 was widely criticised as being driven by factional politics within the governing party rather than by genuine governance concerns.

Second, administrators appointed under Section 139 often lack the skills, resources, or authority to address root causes. They may stabilise an immediate financial crisis — ensuring that salaries are paid and creditors are managed — without fixing the institutional weaknesses (unqualified staff, broken systems, governance failures) that caused the crisis.

Third, interventions tend to end with the same conditions that triggered them. The administrator leaves, the elected council resumes power, and the municipality slides back into dysfunction. This pattern — intervene, stabilise temporarily, withdraw, revert — has been repeated across dozens of municipalities.

Fourth, the accountability of administrators themselves is weak. Several Section 139 administrators have been implicated in irregular expenditure, tender irregularities, or conflicts of interest during their tenure. The entity sent to fix governance failures sometimes commits governance failures of its own.

The most devastating recent example is the Enoch Mgijima Local Municipality in the Eastern Cape, which was placed under administration in 2019 after a financial crisis. The administrator appointed by the province was later found by the Auditor-General to have overseen continued irregular expenditure during the intervention period. The municipality emerged from administration with its financial position arguably worse than when the intervention began.

### What the Intervention Track Record Tells You

The pattern across both Section 100 and Section 139 interventions reveals a systemic weakness in South Africa's cooperative governance design. The intervention mechanisms exist, but they assume that the intervening sphere has the capacity, the competence, and the political neutrality to fix the failing sphere. These assumptions frequently do not hold. National government does not always have the capacity to fix provincial failures. Provincial government does not always have the capacity — or the political neutrality — to fix municipal failures.

For you as a citizen, the practical implication is sobering: the intervention mechanisms are not a reliable safety net. You cannot assume that when your municipality fails, the province will step in and fix it. You cannot assume that when your province fails, national government will ride to the rescue. The intergovernmental system's emergency brakes work intermittently at best. This makes the primary accountability mechanisms — elections, oversight bodies, courts, and citizen engagement — all the more important, because the backup systems cannot be relied upon.

## Intergovernmental Disputes: When Spheres Fight

When the cooperative governance system breaks down completely and spheres find themselves in direct conflict, the Constitution provides a dispute resolution pathway. Section 41(3) requires spheres to make every reasonable effort to resolve disputes through intergovernmental mechanisms before approaching a court. The IGRFA elaborates this requirement, establishing a process of consultation, negotiation, and if necessary, facilitation by a designated facilitator.

In practice, intergovernmental disputes have increasingly ended up in court despite the constitutional preference for negotiated settlement. The cases that reach the courts tend to involve fundamental disagreements about the boundaries of each sphere's powers — disputes that the intergovernmental forums, with their advisory nature and consensus-seeking culture, are ill-equipped to resolve.

The Constitutional Court has played a particularly important role in defining the boundaries of intergovernmental relations. In the landmark case of *Certification of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa* (1996), the Court established the foundational principles for how the spheres relate. In *Premier of the Western Cape v President of the Republic of South Africa* (1999), the Court clarified the limits of national power over provinces. More recently, in disputes between the City of Cape Town and the national Minister of Water and Sanitation, the courts have had to adjudicate the boundaries between national and municipal water functions — precisely the kind of operational boundary dispute that the intergovernmental system should be resolving internally but cannot.

The increasing judicialisation of intergovernmental disputes is a symptom of the cooperative governance system's weakness. When spheres trust each other and the forums function, disputes are resolved through negotiation. When trust breaks down — as it inevitably does when spheres are controlled by different political parties, or when one sphere is perceived to be acting in bad faith — the courts become the default dispute resolution mechanism, despite the Constitution's clear preference for intergovernmental solutions.

:::expert
Comparative governance research, including analyses by the Public Affairs Research Institute and the Forum of Federations, places South Africa's intergovernmental experience in a broader context. Every federal or quasi-federal system struggles with intergovernmental coordination — Germany has its Bundesrat, Australia has its Council of Australian Governments (now the National Cabinet), Canada has its First Ministers' Conferences. What distinguishes South Africa, as multiple comparative studies have noted, is the combination of an extremely elaborate formal framework — the IGRFA creates more intergovernmental forums than almost any comparable system — with extremely weak enforcement mechanisms. Germany's Basic Law provides constitutional mechanisms to compel compliance with federal laws. Australia's Commonwealth can use its fiscal dominance to force state cooperation. South Africa has forums that recommend and a Constitution that presumes good faith. The gap between the architecture of cooperation and the teeth of cooperation — the ability to enforce coordinated action when voluntary compliance fails — is the structural weakness that comparative analysis consistently identifies in the South African model.

## Cooperative Governance in Practice: Case Studies

Understanding how the intergovernmental system works in the abstract is one thing. Seeing how it functions — or fails to function — in concrete situations is another. Three case studies illustrate the range of intergovernmental dynamics that shape your experience of government services.

### Case Study 1: The COVID-19 Response

The COVID-19 pandemic was the most severe test of South Africa's intergovernmental system since the democratic transition. The response required extraordinary coordination across all three spheres: national government declared the state of disaster and set the regulatory framework (lockdown levels, vaccination strategy, economic relief), provincial governments managed the health response (hospitals, testing, contact tracing), and municipalities managed the local implications (water provision for hygiene, enforcement of regulations, continuation of basic services).

The National Coronavirus Command Council (NCCC), chaired by the president, became the de facto apex intergovernmental structure for the pandemic response, replacing or supplementing the normal PCC and MinMEC structures. The health MinMEC met frequently — sometimes weekly — to coordinate the health response across provinces. Provincial premiers held their own coordination meetings with district and metropolitan mayors.

Some aspects of this coordination worked well. The national vaccination programme, once it was operational, achieved reasonable coordination between national procurement (vaccine acquisition through the national Department of Health), provincial distribution (vaccine sites managed by provincial health departments), and municipal support (venues, logistics, local communication). The national government's social relief package, including the SRD grant, was implemented through SASSA's national systems and reached millions of beneficiaries.

Other aspects revealed the system's weaknesses. Water provision in informal settlements — a critical hygiene measure — required coordination between national (water boards), provincial (health), and municipal (water reticulation) spheres, and the response was slow and uneven. Enforcement of lockdown regulations varied wildly between municipalities, with some metropolitan municipalities deploying law enforcement aggressively and rural municipalities having no enforcement capacity at all. The economic relief programmes, particularly for small businesses, were fragmented across national departments with no effective municipal delivery mechanism.

### Case Study 2: The Durban Floods of 2022

The April 2022 floods in KwaZulu-Natal, which killed over 400 people and caused an estimated R17 billion in damage, exposed the intergovernmental disaster management system at its most critical moment. Disaster management is a concurrent function under Schedule 4 of the Constitution. The national Disaster Management Centre coordinates the national response. The provincial disaster management centre manages the provincial response. Municipalities manage the local response.

The floods overwhelmed all three levels of the disaster management system simultaneously. Municipal infrastructure — roads, water treatment works, sanitation systems — was destroyed. Provincial health facilities were damaged. National infrastructure, including portions of the N2 and N3 highways and key port infrastructure in Durban, was severely affected.

The intergovernmental response was slow and poorly coordinated. The national declaration of a state of disaster activated funding mechanisms, but the disbursement of disaster relief funds to the municipality was delayed by bureaucratic processes and capacity constraints. The eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality, already under financial strain before the floods, lacked the project management capacity to plan and execute the massive reconstruction programme required. The provincial government's coordination role was hampered by its own institutional weaknesses. Months after the floods, affected communities were still without basic services, and reconstruction was far behind schedule.

The post-disaster assessment, conducted by multiple organisations including the South African Institution of Civil Engineering, identified intergovernmental coordination failure as a primary factor in the slow recovery. The disaster management system, designed on paper to enable rapid cross-sphere coordination, was unable to translate that design into effective operational response when it mattered most.

### Case Study 3: Electricity and the Energy Transition

The ongoing electricity crisis — characterised by load shedding from Eskom, a national SOE — has forced an intergovernmental reckoning that was not anticipated by the Constitution's framers. Electricity generation is a national function. Electricity distribution in most urban areas is a municipal function. But as municipalities have increasingly sought to procure their own electricity from independent power producers to reduce their dependence on Eskom, the intergovernmental boundaries have become contested.

The City of Cape Town's efforts to procure renewable energy independently brought it into direct conflict with the national regulatory framework, which historically required all electricity to be purchased from or through Eskom. The resulting legal and regulatory battles — involving the national Department of Mineral Resources and Energy, the National Energy Regulator (NERSA), Eskom, and multiple municipalities — illustrate how the intergovernmental system struggles to adapt when circumstances change faster than the constitutional and legislative framework anticipated.

The Electricity Regulation Amendment Act and subsequent regulatory changes eventually allowed municipalities to procure electricity independently, but the process took years of intergovernmental friction, litigation threats, and political negotiation. The municipal electricity procurement framework that is now emerging required coordination between national energy policy, national treasury regulations on municipal procurement, provincial oversight of municipal financial management, and municipal-level implementation — precisely the kind of multi-sphere coordination that the intergovernmental system is supposed to facilitate but struggled to deliver.

## The Informal Channels: How Coordination Actually Happens

Alongside the formal intergovernmental forums mandated by the IGRFA, a significant amount of coordination happens through informal channels that are not captured in any legislation. These include direct relationships between officials who have worked together across spheres, political party structures that span all three levels of government, professional networks (engineers, accountants, planners) that connect practitioners across spheres, and ad hoc task teams created to address specific problems.

In many cases, these informal channels are more effective than the formal forums. A provincial HOD who has a personal relationship with a municipal manager can resolve a coordination problem with a phone call that a formal intergovernmental forum might take six months to address. A national DG who previously served in provincial government understands provincial implementation constraints in a way that their predecessor, who came from the private sector, did not.

The risk of relying on informal channels is that they are personality-dependent and therefore fragile. When the HOD changes, the relationship ends. When the DG moves on, the understanding is lost. The formal intergovernmental system is supposed to provide institutional continuity that survives personnel changes, but its weakness means that the informal system carries a disproportionate coordination burden — and when key individuals leave, coordination can collapse overnight.

## What Needs to Change: The Reform Debate

South Africa's intergovernmental relations system has been the subject of extensive debate among governance scholars, practitioners, and policymakers. Several reform proposals recur in the literature, and understanding them helps you evaluate what your government is — or is not — doing to fix the system.

The first and most widely supported proposal is to give intergovernmental forums decision-making power rather than merely advisory roles. If a MinMEC agrees on an implementation timeline, that agreement should be binding on all spheres, with consequences for non-compliance. This would require amending the IGRFA and possibly the Constitution, and it raises legitimate concerns about which sphere's interests prevail when there is genuine disagreement — but the current purely advisory model has demonstrably failed to produce coordination.

The second proposal is to strengthen the NCOP so that it functions as a genuine provincial voice in national legislation rather than a party-political rubber stamp. Reforms could include requiring longer consultation periods for Section 76 bills, mandating that provincial legislatures hold public hearings before issuing mandates to their NCOP delegations, and providing the NCOP with independent research and analytical capacity so that it can evaluate legislation's provincial impact without relying on national government's assessments.

The third proposal is to reform the intervention mechanisms. Section 100 and Section 139 interventions could be improved by establishing a professional cadre of intervention specialists, requiring independent monitoring of interventions, setting clear exit criteria that must be met before an intervention ends, and creating accountability mechanisms for administrators who commit irregularities during interventions.

The fourth proposal, more radical, is to rethink the three-sphere model itself — not by abolishing provinces (which would require a constitutional amendment with an almost impossibly high threshold) but by rationalising the allocation of functions. Some scholars argue that certain functions currently shared between spheres should be consolidated in a single sphere to eliminate coordination failures. Others argue that the district municipal tier should be reformed or abolished, reducing the layering of functions between district and local municipalities.

## The Practical Toolkit: Navigating the Intergovernmental System

:::framework
**The Intergovernmental Navigation Framework**

As a citizen, you cannot fix the intergovernmental system's structural weaknesses. But you can navigate the system more effectively by understanding how it works and using that understanding to pursue accountability. Here is a five-step approach.

**Step 1: Identify whether your problem is a single-sphere or multi-sphere failure.**

Some service delivery problems have a clear single-sphere owner — your refuse is not collected (municipal), the ambulance does not arrive (provincial), your ID takes four months (national). Use the accountability map from Article 1.2 to identify the responsible sphere and engage directly. But if your problem involves functions that span spheres — contaminated water (national bulk supply and municipal reticulation), a housing project that has stalled (national funding, provincial project management, municipal land and infrastructure), a school without water (provincial education, municipal water services) — you are dealing with an intergovernmental coordination failure and need to engage multiple spheres.

**Step 2: Identify the relevant intergovernmental forum.**

Every functional area has an intergovernmental forum structure. Education has the education MinMEC. Health has the health MinMEC. Water has its own intergovernmental structures. At the provincial level, the Premier's Intergovernmental Forum coordinates between the province and its municipalities. At the district level, the District Intergovernmental Forum coordinates between the district and local municipalities. When your problem is a coordination failure, the relevant forum is where the coordination should be happening — and its failure to coordinate is itself a governance failure you can raise.

**Step 3: Use the Auditor-General's findings as your evidence base.**

The Auditor-General's annual reports do not only assess individual departments and municipalities — they also identify systemic intergovernmental coordination failures. When AGSA reports that a conditional grant was underspent because the municipality lacked capacity to comply with the grant conditions, that is an intergovernmental failure: national set conditions the municipality could not meet, and the province failed in its oversight role. Use these findings to build an evidence-based case for intergovernmental accountability.

**Step 4: Engage the oversight bodies that span spheres.**

The Public Protector can investigate maladministration by any organ of state in any sphere. The South African Human Rights Commission can investigate rights violations regardless of which sphere is responsible. Parliamentary and provincial legislature portfolio committees can summon ministers, MECs, and officials to account for coordination failures. The NCOP's select committees have a specific mandate to examine how national legislation affects provinces and municipalities. These oversight bodies are not constrained by the boundaries between spheres and can investigate failures that cross those boundaries.

**Step 5: Document and publicise the coordination failure.**

Many intergovernmental coordination failures persist because they are invisible to the public. Nobody is watching the MinMEC. Nobody is tracking whether the District Intergovernmental Forum meets. Nobody is measuring whether the intergovernmental coordination mechanisms are producing coordination. When you encounter a service delivery failure that results from poor coordination between spheres, documenting it — through media, through civil society organisations, through social media, through formal complaints — creates the public pressure that the intergovernmental system's internal mechanisms lack. The cooperative governance model was designed to work through good faith. When good faith is absent, public scrutiny is the most effective substitute.

## Where to Go From Here

You now understand the connective tissue of South Africa's governance architecture. The three spheres do not operate in isolation — they are linked by the IGRFA's forum structure, by the fiscal coordination mechanisms centred on the Budget Council and National Treasury, by the NCOP's legislative bridge, and by the intervention powers of Sections 100 and 139. You understand that this connective tissue is weaker than it appears — forums are advisory, interventions are unreliable, and the informal channels that often produce the best coordination are fragile and personality-dependent.

This understanding completes the foundational framework of Part 1. You know the architecture of the state (Article 1.1), who does what within that architecture (Article 1.2), and how the parts are supposed to work together (this article). In the next part of this series, we will turn to the money — *Following the Money* will trace exactly how nationally raised revenue flows through the Division of Revenue Act to the provinces and municipalities that deliver your services, and where it gets lost along the way. Because understanding the architecture and the responsibilities is essential, but understanding the fiscal plumbing is what gives you the power to follow the resources and demand results.
