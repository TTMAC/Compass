## The Single Most Important Thing You Need to Know About How South Africa Is Governed

In 1996, South Africa's Constitutional Assembly did something remarkably ambitious. They designed a system of government that divided power not into the familiar hierarchy of national, regional, and local—with each level subordinate to the one above—but into three constitutionally equal "spheres" of government, each with its own protected powers, its own revenue sources, and its own democratic mandate. This design, enshrined in Chapter 3 of the Constitution, created one of the most complex multi-sphere governance architectures in the developing world. It was a deliberate choice, born from the specific pathologies of apartheid's centralised authoritarian state, and it has shaped every aspect of how services reach you—or fail to reach you—for the past three decades.

Here is the core takeaway, and everything else in this article exists to prove it: **if you do not understand how power is divided across South Africa's three spheres of government, you cannot hold the right people accountable when things go wrong.** You will shout at the president about potholes (a municipal function). You will blame your mayor for the state of public hospitals (a provincial function). You will march on the Union Buildings about your property rates (a municipal function) or demand that your ward councillor fix the police service (a national function). This misdirected anger is not your fault. Nobody taught you the architecture of the state. But it means your energy—and South Africa has no shortage of civic energy—gets wasted on the wrong targets, and the officials who are actually responsible escape scrutiny. This article exists to fix that.

## Why "Spheres" and Not "Tiers": The Framers' Deliberate Choice

The word "spheres" appears in Section 40(1) of the Constitution: "In the Republic, government is constituted as national, provincial and local spheres of government which are distinctive, interdependent and interrelated." That phrasing was not an accident. The drafters of the Constitution—drawing on the experiences of federal systems in Germany, India, and Nigeria, but adapting them for South Africa's particular history—deliberately rejected the words "tiers" and "levels." Those words imply hierarchy: national government at the top, provincial government in the middle, local government at the bottom. The Constitution's framers wanted something different. They wanted three spheres of government that were constitutionally equal in status, even if they differed dramatically in scope and capacity.

This distinction matters more than it might seem. In a hierarchical system, a national government can simply override a provincial or local decision. In South Africa's cooperative governance model, each sphere has constitutionally protected turf. National government cannot, in ordinary circumstances, simply take over a provincial function because it disagrees with how the province is handling it. There are override mechanisms—Section 100 allows national intervention in provincial government, and Section 139 allows provincial intervention in municipal government—but these are extraordinary measures with specific constitutional requirements, not routine management tools.

The practical implication for you is this: when you encounter a government failure, you need to ask which sphere is responsible before you can identify whom to hold accountable. The three spheres are not interchangeable, and the officials in one sphere are generally not answerable for the failures of another.

:::takeaway
South Africa's Constitution deliberately uses "spheres" rather than "tiers" or "levels" to describe its three parts of government. This is not semantic fussiness—it reflects a constitutional design in which national, provincial, and municipal government are equal in status, each with protected powers. Understanding which sphere is responsible for a given function is the essential first step in holding the right officials accountable.

## Cooperative Governance: The Constitutional Design

Chapter 3 of the Constitution—titled "Co-operative Government"—sets out the principles that govern how the three spheres relate to each other. Section 41 requires all spheres to preserve the peace, the national unity, and the indivisibility of the Republic, to secure the well-being of the people, to provide effective and transparent government, and—critically—to "co-operate with one another in mutual trust and good faith."

In practice, cooperative governance means that the three spheres are supposed to work together rather than in isolation. National government sets the broad policy framework and passes legislation. Provincial government adapts national policy to provincial conditions and implements it. Municipal government delivers services directly to you—the water that comes out of your tap, the electricity that powers your home, the refuse that gets collected from your street, the local roads you drive on every day.

This sounds tidy on paper. In reality, the boundaries between spheres are anything but clean. Housing policy is set nationally, but housing delivery involves national funding, provincial departments, and municipal land-use planning. Education policy is national, but school management is provincial, and the physical condition of school buildings often depends on municipal infrastructure services like water and sanitation. Health policy is national, but hospitals and clinics are run by provinces, while the environmental health conditions that drive disease—clean water, proper sanitation, waste removal—are municipal responsibilities.

These overlaps are not bugs in the system. They are features of the cooperative governance design. The Constitution's framers understood that government functions do not fit neatly into boxes. They designed a system that requires the three spheres to work together, with formal intergovernmental structures—the President's Coordinating Council, MinMECs (meetings between national ministers and provincial MECs), and various technical forums—to manage the coordination.

The problem is that cooperative governance requires goodwill, competence, and functional institutions in all three spheres simultaneously. When any one sphere lacks these qualities—and in South Africa, dysfunction is unevenly distributed but widespread—the entire cooperative architecture strains.

:::expert
Research by the Public Affairs Research Institute (PARI) and the Wits School of Governance has documented a persistent gap between the cooperative governance model's design and its implementation. Their analyses of intergovernmental forums across multiple sectors reveal that the formal structures — the MinMECs, the technical working groups, the intergovernmental forums established by the IGRFA — tend to function as information-sharing sessions rather than genuine coordination mechanisms. The meetings occur on schedule, agendas are circulated, and attendance is recorded, but the substantive alignment between national policy and provincial implementation that these forums are supposed to produce often does not materialise. The cooperative governance model, these researchers have argued, was designed for a state with uniformly high capacity across all three spheres — a condition South Africa has never met. The Presidency's *Twenty Year Review: South Africa 1994–2014* reached a similar conclusion, finding that cooperative governance remained "aspirational rather than operational" in many sectors. The gap between the model's assumptions and the country's institutional reality is the central tension of the governance architecture.

## What Each Sphere Actually Does: A Plain-Language Guide

Let us get specific. The Constitution, in Schedules 4 and 5, sets out exactly which functions belong to which sphere—and where they overlap. These schedules are the operating manual for South Africa's governance architecture, and understanding them is the key to tracing accountability.

### Schedule 4: Concurrent Powers (Shared Between National and Provincial)

Schedule 4 lists functions that both national and provincial government can legislate on. When there is a conflict between national and provincial legislation on a Schedule 4 matter, Section 146 of the Constitution provides criteria for resolving it—generally, but not always, in favour of national legislation. The key concurrent functions include agriculture, cultural matters, disaster management, education at all levels excluding tertiary (universities are exclusively national), environment, health services, housing, indigenous law and customary law, industrial promotion, language policy, media services directly controlled or provided by the government, nature conservation, police (to the extent that Section 206(3)–(5) apply to provinces), population development, property transfer fees, public transport, public works, regional planning and development, road traffic regulation, soil conservation, tourism, trade, traditional leadership, urban and rural development, vehicle licensing, and welfare services.

That is a long list, and the practical significance is enormous. Take housing as an example. The national Department of Human Settlements sets housing policy and administers the national housing subsidy. But provincial departments of human settlements manage housing delivery programmes, allocate subsidies to specific projects, and work with municipalities on land identification and infrastructure provision. When a housing project stalls—and South Africa's housing backlog stood at approximately 2.3 million units as of 2023, according to the Department of Human Settlements—the failure could lie with the national department (policy bottlenecks, funding delays), the provincial department (poor project management, corruption in tender processes), or the municipality (failure to provide bulk infrastructure like water and sewerage connections, or delays in land-use approvals). Often, it is a combination of all three.

Health services provide another vivid example. National government, through the Department of Health, sets policy, regulates the health professions, manages the national health insurance framework, and runs specialised facilities. Provincial governments run the hospitals and primary healthcare clinics where most South Africans access healthcare. But the environmental health conditions that drive disease—clean drinking water, functioning sewage systems, refuse removal—are municipal responsibilities. When there is a cholera outbreak, as occurred in Hammanskraal in 2023 with at least 23 deaths and over 1,000 reported cases (National Institute for Communicable Diseases data), the causes typically span all three spheres: deteriorating municipal water infrastructure, inadequate provincial health response capacity, and insufficient national regulatory oversight.

### Schedule 5: Exclusive Powers

Schedule 5 is divided into two parts. Part A lists functions that are exclusively provincial—meaning only provincial government can legislate on them. Part B lists functions that are exclusively municipal.

Provincial exclusive functions (Schedule 5, Part A) include abattoirs, ambulance services, archives (other than national archives), libraries (other than national libraries), liquor licences, museums (other than national museums), provincial planning, provincial cultural matters, provincial recreation and amenities, provincial roads and traffic, and veterinary services.

Municipal exclusive functions (Schedule 5, Part B) include beaches and amusement facilities, billboards and advertising in public places, cemeteries and crematoria, cleansing, control of public nuisances, control of undertakings that sell liquor to the public, facilities for the accommodation and burial of animals, fencing and fences, licensing of dogs, licensing and control of undertakings that sell food to the public, local amenities, local sport facilities, markets, municipal abattoirs, municipal parks and recreation, municipal roads, noise pollution, pounds, public places, refuse removal and solid waste disposal, street trading, street lighting, and traffic and parking.

These exclusive functions are constitutionally protected—the other spheres cannot simply legislate over them. This is why your municipality is responsible for your refuse collection, your local roads, your street lights, and your local parks. It is also why your province controls liquor licences, ambulance services, and provincial roads.

### The Grey Areas: Where Functions Overlap and Accountability Blurs

The neat division of Schedules 4 and 5 breaks down in practice because many real-world problems span multiple functions and therefore multiple spheres. Consider water. Bulk water supply—the dams, the treatment works, the main pipelines—is a national function managed through the Department of Water and Sanitation and water boards like Rand Water and Umgeni Water. But water reticulation—the pipes that carry water from the municipal reservoir to your tap—is a municipal function. When your water stops running, the problem might be a bulk supply failure (national/water board), a reticulation failure (municipal), or both. The 2023 water crisis in Johannesburg illustrated this perfectly: Rand Water (a national entity) was supplying bulk water to the city, but the City of Johannesburg's ageing and poorly maintained reticulation network was losing an estimated 46% of water to leaks and theft, according to the city's own infrastructure reports. Who was responsible? Both spheres were, in different ways, and neither could solve the problem alone.

Policing presents a similar complexity. The South African Police Service (SAPS) is a national function under the Minister of Police. But Section 206 of the Constitution gives provincial executives certain powers over policing, including the ability to investigate complaints about police conduct and to monitor police effectiveness. Municipalities, meanwhile, can establish metropolitan police services with limited powers. When crime is high in your neighbourhood, the primary responsibility lies with SAPS (national), but provincial government has an oversight role, and your municipality may or may not have invested in metropolitan or traffic policing. This layering of responsibilities across spheres is designed to create checks and balances, but it often creates confusion and finger-pointing instead.

:::expert
Dr Vinothan Naidoo, a political scientist at the University of Cape Town, has published extensively on the operational contradictions created by the constitutional division of water functions between spheres. In his analysis of water service coordination in South Africa's metropolitan municipalities, published in the *Journal of Public Administration* (2016), Naidoo demonstrates that the governance architecture separates bulk supply (national) from reticulation (municipal), but the physical infrastructure connects them through a single network that does not recognise constitutional boundaries. His research shows that municipal water crises cannot be resolved without coordinating with national water boards, and that bulk supply planning requires understanding municipal demand patterns. The governance framework treats these as separable functions assigned to different spheres, but the engineering reality demands integrated management that the intergovernmental system struggles to deliver.

## Following the Money: How the Fiscal Architecture Works

Understanding which sphere is responsible for a function is only half the picture. The other half is understanding who pays for it—and how money flows through the system. South Africa's fiscal architecture is one of the most centralised in the world among countries with multi-sphere governance, and this centralisation creates both dependencies and distortions that affect every service you receive.

### The Revenue Reality

Here is the fundamental fiscal fact of South Africa's governance: national government collects the vast majority of all tax revenue—approximately 93% in the 2023/24 financial year, according to National Treasury budget data. The South African Revenue Service (SARS), a national entity, collects income tax, VAT, corporate tax, customs duties, and excise taxes. Provinces have almost no independent revenue-raising capacity. They receive tiny amounts from motor vehicle licence fees, gambling taxes, and provincial liquor licences, but these typically account for less than 5% of a province's total budget. Municipalities have somewhat more fiscal autonomy—they raise revenue through property rates, service charges (water, electricity, refuse), and various fees and levies—but many municipalities, particularly rural ones, have thin revenue bases and depend heavily on national transfers.

This means that even though the Constitution assigns significant service delivery responsibilities to provinces and municipalities, the money to fund those services overwhelmingly comes from the national government. In the 2024/25 financial year, national transfers to provinces totalled approximately R756 billion, while transfers to local government totalled approximately R163 billion, as set out in the Division of Revenue Act (National Treasury, 2024 Budget Review).

### The Division of Revenue Act (DORA)

Every year, Parliament passes the Division of Revenue Act, which determines how nationally raised revenue is divided among the three spheres. This is not a one-off constitutional formula—it is an annual political and fiscal negotiation, informed by recommendations from the Financial and Fiscal Commission (FFC), an independent constitutional body established under Section 220 of the Constitution.

The division happens in two stages. First, the national "fiscal framework" determines the vertical division—how much goes to each sphere in aggregate. Then, the horizontal division determines how each sphere's allocation is shared among its constituent parts (nine provinces, 257 municipalities).

The money flows to provinces and municipalities through two main channels. The first is the equitable share, which is an unconditional allocation that provinces and municipalities can spend according to their own priorities (within their constitutional mandates). The second is conditional grants, which are earmarked for specific purposes—the Municipal Infrastructure Grant for infrastructure, the Education Infrastructure Grant for school buildings, the Human Settlements Development Grant for housing, and dozens more.

### The Equitable Share Formula

The provincial equitable share formula is the mechanism that determines how nationally raised revenue is distributed among the nine provinces. The formula has several components, each weighted differently. The education component (which accounts for the largest share, approximately 48% of the formula) is based on school-age population and the number of learners in public schools. The health component (approximately 27%) is based on the population with and without access to medical aid. The basic component (approximately 16%) is based on each province's share of the national population. There are also components for institutional capacity, poverty, and economic activity.

The municipal equitable share formula works differently. It is designed to provide municipalities with the funding to deliver free basic services to poor households—free basic water (6 kilolitres per household per month), free basic electricity (50 kWh per household per month), free basic sanitation, and free basic refuse removal. The formula takes into account the number of poor households in each municipality, the cost of providing basic services, and the municipality's own revenue-raising capacity.

### Where the Fiscal Architecture Creates Problems

This fiscal architecture—centralised revenue collection, formula-based transfers, conditional grants—creates several systemic problems that directly affect service delivery.

The first is the "principal-agent problem." National government funds services that provinces and municipalities deliver. This means the entity paying is not the entity implementing, which makes accountability murky. When a provincial hospital is understaffed, is that because national government allocated insufficient funding, because the provincial treasury misspent the allocation, or because the provincial health department has a human resources management failure? The answer is often "all of the above," but the fiscal separation makes it easy for each sphere to blame the other.

The second problem is what fiscal scholars call the "flypaper effect"—money sticks where it lands. Provinces and municipalities that receive large unconditional transfers can become dependent on national funding and lose the incentive to manage efficiently or raise their own revenue. In the 2022/23 financial year, the Auditor-General of South Africa (AGSA) reported that only 28 of 257 municipalities received clean audits, meaning they produced financial statements free of material misstatements and had no material findings on compliance with legislation or performance information (AGSA, 2022/23 MFMA Consolidated General Report). The majority of municipalities—particularly smaller and more rural ones—show persistent financial management failures year after year, despite receiving substantial national transfers.

The third problem is the conditional grant system itself. Conditional grants come with spending conditions and reporting requirements, which in theory ensure that money is spent on its intended purpose. In practice, many municipalities lack the administrative capacity to comply with grant conditions, leading to underspending (the municipality cannot spend the money it has been allocated) or irregular expenditure (the municipality spends the money but not in compliance with the rules). In the 2022/23 financial year, AGSA reported irregular expenditure of R53.55 billion across local government—a figure that represents money spent outside the rules, not necessarily money stolen, but money that cannot be verified as having been spent correctly.

:::takeaway
South Africa's national government collects approximately 93% of all tax revenue and transfers the bulk of it to provinces and municipalities through the Division of Revenue Act. This fiscal centralisation means that the entity funding services is usually not the entity delivering them, creating accountability gaps where each sphere can blame the others for failures. Understanding this fiscal architecture—how money flows from SARS through National Treasury through DORA to the province or municipality that ultimately delivers your services—is essential to understanding why services fail.

## The National Council of Provinces: Does It Work?

The Constitution created the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) as the second chamber of Parliament, specifically designed to ensure that provincial interests are represented in national lawmaking. Section 42(4) states that the NCOP "represents the provinces to ensure that provincial interests are taken into account in the national sphere of government." It does this primarily by participating in the national legislative process—all legislation that affects provinces must be considered by the NCOP, and for legislation that falls under Schedule 4 (concurrent powers), the NCOP's approval is required.

In theory, the NCOP is a critical mechanism in the cooperative governance architecture. It is the institutional bridge between the national and provincial spheres, ensuring that national legislation does not ride roughshod over provincial prerogatives. Each province's delegation to the NCOP consists of 10 delegates—six permanent members (proportional representation) and four special delegates (including the province's premier). Voting on most matters follows a "one province, one vote" system—each province's delegation must vote as a bloc, with the provincial legislature's mandate determining the vote.

In practice, the NCOP has been widely criticised as a rubber stamp rather than a genuine deliberative body. Political party discipline overwhelms provincial interest representation. When a single party controls both the national government and the majority of provincial governments, NCOP delegates tend to vote along party lines rather than advocating for their province's distinct interests. This was the case for much of the post-1994 era, when the African National Congress controlled the national government and most provincial governments simultaneously.

The NCOP's "Taking Parliament to the People" programme, in which the NCOP holds sessions in provinces and takes public submissions, has been praised as an effort to connect the institution to ordinary citizens. But critics argue that the programme is more performative than substantive—public submissions are heard but rarely result in meaningful changes to legislation. A 2019 study by the Parliamentary Monitoring Group found that the NCOP's section 76 process (for legislation affecting provinces) often operates on tight timelines that leave provincial legislatures insufficient time to formulate mandates, reducing the NCOP's provincial representation function to a formality.

The rise of coalition governance in several provinces after the 2024 general elections has created a new dynamic. With no single party commanding a majority in the NCOP, the institution now has the potential to function more as the framers intended—as a genuinely deliberative body where provincial interests, rather than party instructions, drive decision-making. Whether this potential will be realised remains to be seen.

:::expert
Research by the Parliamentary Monitoring Group (PMG), which has tracked NCOP proceedings since 1998, reveals a consistent pattern: the NCOP's Section 76 process — through which provinces are supposed to deliberate on legislation affecting their interests — has frequently operated on compressed timelines that give provincial legislatures inadequate time to formulate meaningful mandates. PMG's analysis of NCOP voting patterns during the period of single-party dominance shows that delegates voted along party lines on virtually all contested legislation, regardless of the differential impact on their provinces. The constitutional vision of a deliberative body that would force national government to take provincial realities seriously was, in practice, reduced to a legislative processing function. The post-2024 coalition dynamics represent the first period in the NCOP's history in which the outcome of votes is genuinely uncertain — creating the conditions for the kind of inter-provincial negotiation and national-provincial bargaining that the Constitution's framers originally intended.
:::

## Intergovernmental Relations: The Machinery of Coordination

The Constitution establishes the principle of cooperative governance, but it is the Intergovernmental Relations Framework Act (IGRFA) of 2005 that creates the practical machinery for implementing it. The IGRFA establishes a system of intergovernmental forums at every level—from the President's Coordinating Council (the president meeting with premiers and the South African Local Government Association) down to district intergovernmental forums where district municipalities coordinate with local municipalities.

The most important of these forums for service delivery are the MinMECs—meetings between national ministers and their counterpart provincial Members of the Executive Council (MECs). There is a MinMEC for each functional area: health, education, human settlements, finance, and so on. These meetings are supposed to be where national policy meets provincial implementation reality, where problems are identified, and where coordinated responses are agreed.

The Forum of South African Directors-General (FOSAD) plays a similar role at the administrative level—national directors-general meeting with their provincial counterparts to coordinate implementation. The technical working groups that feed into these forums are where much of the substantive coordination work is supposed to happen.

In practice, the intergovernmental relations system suffers from several weaknesses. The forums are advisory, not decision-making—they can identify problems and recommend solutions, but they cannot compel any sphere to act. Attendance is often uneven, with senior officials delegating to juniors who lack the authority to make commitments. The frequency of meetings does not match the urgency of service delivery challenges—quarterly meetings cannot address daily operational crises. And the intergovernmental system has no effective mechanism for resolving disputes between spheres, short of litigation. Section 41(3) of the Constitution requires spheres to "make every reasonable effort to settle [intergovernmental] disputes" before approaching a court, but the mechanisms for doing so are weak.

The result is a governance system that is better at coordination on paper than in practice. National policy gets made in Pretoria, provincial implementation plans get drafted in provincial capitals, and municipal service delivery happens (or does not happen) in 257 municipalities—with the connections between these three levels of activity often more notional than real.

## When the Architecture Fails: Section 100 and Section 139 Interventions

The Constitution recognises that cooperative governance will sometimes fail and provides emergency mechanisms for one sphere to intervene in another. Section 100 allows national government to intervene in a province when the province "cannot or does not fulfil an executive obligation in terms of the Constitution or legislation." Section 139 allows provincial government to intervene in a municipality under similar circumstances.

These interventions come in escalating severity. Section 139(1)(a) allows the province to issue a directive to the municipality. Section 139(1)(b) allows the province to assume responsibility for the relevant obligation, effectively taking over a municipal function. Section 139(1)(c) allows the province to dissolve a municipal council and appoint an administrator—the nuclear option.

The track record of these interventions is, candidly, poor. A 2020 study by the Public Affairs Research Institute (PARI) analysed Section 139 interventions in municipalities and found that the majority failed to achieve their objectives. Interventions were often politically motivated rather than technically justified, administrators lacked the capacity or authority to address root causes, and the interventions ended with the same dysfunctional conditions that triggered them. The PARI study documented cases where administrators appointed under Section 139 were themselves implicated in irregular expenditure, creating a grim irony: the entity sent to fix financial mismanagement was itself mismanaging finances.

Section 100 interventions in provinces are rarer but not more successful. The national government's intervention in the Limpopo provincial administration in 2011—placing five provincial departments under national administration—was the most extensive use of Section 100 to date. While it stabilised some acute crises (the Limpopo textbook debacle being the most prominent), it did not address the underlying institutional weaknesses, and the province reverted to many of the same patterns after the intervention ended.

The lesson for you as a citizen is this: the intervention mechanisms exist, but they are not a reliable safety net. The cooperative governance system depends on each sphere functioning reasonably well. When a sphere fails, the intervention tools are blunt instruments that often fail to fix the underlying problems.

## The Provincial Question: Should South Africa Even Have Provinces?

No discussion of South Africa's governance architecture is complete without addressing the recurring question: should South Africa have provinces at all? This debate has been live since the constitutional negotiations of 1993–1996, when the inclusion of provinces was one of the most contested issues. The African National Congress initially favoured a unitary state with no provinces, arguing that provinces would entrench apartheid-era Bantustan boundaries and fragment national unity. The Inkatha Freedom Party and the National Party pushed for strong federalism. The compromise was nine provinces with limited powers—more than a unitary state, less than a federation.

The case against provinces rests on several arguments. Provinces are expensive to run—nine premiers, nine provincial legislatures, nine sets of provincial departments, each with its own bureaucracy. Several provinces—the Northern Cape, with its vast geography and small population, or the Free State—arguably lack the economic base to justify a full provincial government apparatus. Provincial exclusive powers (Schedule 5, Part A) are limited to relatively minor functions like liquor licences and libraries. The bulk of what provinces do—education and health—are concurrent functions where national government sets the policy framework anyway.

The case for provinces, however, is also strong. South Africa is a large and diverse country. The needs of rural Limpopo are different from the needs of urban Gauteng. Provincial government provides a mechanism for adapting national policy to local conditions. Provincial government also provides an alternative centre of political power—the Western Cape's governance by a party different from the national government has provided a visible benchmark for comparing governance approaches. And the nine provinces, whatever their origins, now have established institutional identities, significant budgets, and thousands of employees. Abolishing them would be an enormously disruptive undertaking with uncertain benefits.

The practical reality is that amending the Constitution to remove or reduce provinces requires a two-thirds majority in the National Assembly and the support of six of nine provincial delegations in the NCOP. This makes abolition politically almost impossible, meaning the debate is largely academic. The more productive question is not whether provinces should exist but how to make the existing provincial system work better—through better fiscal incentives, stronger performance management, and more effective intergovernmental coordination.

## What This Architecture Means for Real Service Delivery

Let us bring all of this back to your lived experience. When you encounter a service delivery problem, the governance architecture determines whom you should hold accountable. Here are the most common services and the spheres responsible for them.

Your water supply involves at least two spheres. The national Department of Water and Sanitation regulates the sector, manages water resource allocation, and oversees the water boards (like Rand Water, Umgeni Water, and Amatola Water) that provide bulk water to municipalities. Your municipality is responsible for water reticulation—maintaining the local pipe network, treating water to drinking standards (if the municipality operates its own treatment works), and billing you for water consumption. When your water stops running, the first question is whether it is a bulk supply problem (contact the relevant water board or check national department communications) or a local reticulation problem (contact your municipality).

Your electricity supply follows a similar pattern. Eskom, a national state-owned entity, generates most of South Africa's electricity and transmits it through the national grid. Your municipality purchases bulk electricity from Eskom and distributes it to your home (if you are a municipal electricity customer—some areas are supplied directly by Eskom). When you experience load shedding, that is a national generation problem. When you experience a local power outage on a day when there is no load shedding, that is most likely a municipal distribution problem.

Your child's school is primarily a provincial responsibility. The provincial Department of Education manages public schools, hires teachers, and determines the allocation of teachers to schools. The national Department of Basic Education sets the curriculum, administers the matric examinations, and provides overall policy direction. School infrastructure—the buildings, the water supply to the school, the sanitation facilities—involves both provincial education departments and municipal services.

Your local clinic is a provincial responsibility. The provincial Department of Health operates primary healthcare clinics and community health centres. National government sets health policy, manages the national health insurance framework, and operates certain specialised facilities. But the environmental health conditions in your community—clean water, sanitation, waste removal—are municipal responsibilities that directly affect the disease burden your clinic has to manage.

Your roads depend on which road you are on. National roads (the N1, N2, N3, and other national routes) are managed by the South African National Roads Agency (SANRAL), a national entity. Provincial roads are managed by provincial departments of public works and roads. Municipal roads—the streets in your neighbourhood—are your municipality's responsibility. The pothole on your suburban street is a municipal problem. The deteriorating surface of the provincial road connecting your town to the next is a provincial problem.

Your safety depends primarily on national government through SAPS, but municipalities can supplement this with metropolitan police services. The lack of police stations, the allocation of police resources, and the overall effectiveness of crime prevention are primarily national responsibilities. Your municipality's by-law enforcement, traffic policing, and fire services are municipal functions.

## The Constitutional Architecture: Design Versus Implementation

One of the most important distinctions you can make as an engaged citizen is between design failures and implementation failures. South Africa's constitutional governance architecture—three spheres, cooperative governance, protected powers, fiscal transfers—is, by most informed assessments, well designed. International governance scholars regularly cite the South African Constitution as one of the most progressive and thoughtfully designed constitutional frameworks in the world. The Bill of Rights is expansive. The Chapter 9 institutions—the Public Protector, the Auditor-General, the Human Rights Commission, and others—provide independent oversight. The cooperative governance model recognises the complexity of governing a large, diverse, post-conflict society.

The problems South Africa faces are overwhelmingly implementation failures, not design failures. The cooperative governance model assumes good faith and competence across all three spheres. The fiscal transfer system assumes that provinces and municipalities will use their allocations efficiently and account for them honestly. The intergovernmental relations framework assumes that forums will be attended by senior officials with decision-making authority who are genuinely committed to coordination. The intervention mechanisms (Sections 100 and 139) assume that the intervening sphere has the capacity and political will to fix the problems.

When these assumptions fail—and they fail regularly—the system underperforms. But the response should be to fix the implementation, not to abandon the design. Replacing the three-sphere model with a centralised unitary system would not solve the problems of corruption, maladministration, and institutional weakness that plague service delivery. It would simply relocate those problems to a single point of failure.

This is why understanding the architecture matters. When you know how the system is designed to work, you can identify where it is failing and why. You can distinguish between a structural problem (the system cannot do what is being asked of it) and a performance problem (the system can do it but the people running it are not doing their jobs). That distinction is the foundation of effective civic engagement.

## The Intergovernmental Fiscal System in Practice: A Case Study

To make the fiscal architecture concrete, consider how money flows for a specific service: providing free basic water to a poor household in a small municipality in the Eastern Cape.

National Treasury, through DORA, allocates an equitable share transfer to the municipality. The municipal equitable share formula includes a component specifically designed to fund free basic services to poor households. In the 2024/25 financial year, the local government equitable share allocation totalled approximately R98.3 billion (National Treasury, 2024 Division of Revenue Bill).

Your municipality receives its portion of this allocation. It is supposed to use the free basic services component to subsidise the first 6 kilolitres of water per household per month for qualifying poor households—a provision established by national policy in 2001.

But here is where the fiscal architecture meets reality. The municipality may lack the billing systems to identify which households qualify. It may lack the metering infrastructure to measure consumption. It may lack the technical capacity to maintain the water reticulation network, meaning that water is being lost to leaks before it reaches households. It may be spending its equitable share on salaries and administrative costs rather than on service delivery—a common pattern identified by AGSA in its annual reports. The national Department of Water and Sanitation may have provided a conditional grant for infrastructure, but the municipality may lack the project management capacity to spend it within the financial year, leading to the grant being returned unspent.

The result: a household that the Constitution entitles to free basic water, in a municipality that has received the funding to provide it, still does not have reliable water. The design is sound. The implementation chain—from national allocation to provincial oversight to municipal delivery—has broken down at multiple points.

This example illustrates why the governance architecture is not just an abstract constitutional question. It is the plumbing (literally, in this case) through which your constitutional rights either reach you or do not.

## The Role of Local Government: Where the Rubber Meets the Road

South Africa's 257 municipalities are where the governance architecture meets your daily life. There are three types: 8 metropolitan municipalities (the large cities—Johannesburg, Cape Town, eThekwini/Durban, Tshwane/Pretoria, Ekurhuleni, Nelson Mandela Bay, Buffalo City, and Mangaung), 44 district municipalities, and 205 local municipalities. Metropolitan municipalities have full executive and legislative authority in their areas. District and local municipalities share functions between them, adding another layer of complexity.

Municipal government is constitutionally responsible for the services that most directly affect your quality of life: water reticulation, electricity distribution, refuse removal, local roads, stormwater drainage, local land-use planning, building regulations, municipal health services, firefighting, local public transport, and municipal parks and recreation. These are the services you interact with every day. They are also, unfortunately, the services most likely to fail.

The reasons for municipal service delivery failures are multiple and well-documented by AGSA, the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (COGTA), and independent researchers. Many municipalities—particularly the smaller and more rural ones—lack the technical and managerial capacity to deliver services effectively. Staff are appointed on the basis of political loyalty rather than competence. Financial management is weak—as evidenced by the AGSA's finding that only 28 of 257 municipalities achieved clean audits in 2022/23. Infrastructure is ageing and underfunded—South African Institution of Civil Engineering (SAICE) infrastructure report cards have consistently graded municipal water and sanitation infrastructure as D or D+, indicating "at risk of failure" or "unfit for purpose." Revenue collection is declining in many municipalities, as residents refuse to pay for services they do not receive, creating a vicious cycle of declining revenue and declining service quality.

The municipal governance crisis is not uniform. Some municipalities—typically the metropolitan municipalities and a handful of well-managed local municipalities—function reasonably well. But the overall picture is one of systemic distress. A 2023 COGTA assessment found that 66 municipalities (roughly one-quarter of all municipalities) were in financial distress, and 43 were "dysfunctional"—unable to fulfil their basic constitutional obligations.

This is the level of government closest to you, and it is, on average, the weakest. That is the central tension of South Africa's governance architecture: the sphere with the most direct impact on your daily life is the sphere with the least capacity to deliver.

## A Practical Framework: How to Trace Accountability

Everything in this article has been building to this: a practical mental model you can use every time you encounter a government service delivery problem. The model is simple, and if you internalise it, you will never again waste your energy shouting at the wrong sphere.

:::framework
**The Sphere Accountability Framework**

When you encounter a service delivery problem, work through these three questions in order:

**Question 1: Which sphere is constitutionally responsible for this function?**

Consult the table below for the most common services. If the function is concurrent (shared between national and provincial), both spheres have a role—national for policy and funding, provincial for implementation. If the function is exclusively provincial or exclusively municipal, start your accountability inquiry there.

**Common functions by sphere:**

National government is responsible for defence and the military, foreign affairs, the South African Police Service (SAPS), higher education and universities, the national road network (via SANRAL), bulk water resources and water boards, Eskom and electricity generation, Home Affairs and identity documents, social grants (via SASSA), and the overall policy framework for concurrent functions like health, education, and housing.

Provincial government is responsible for public schools and school management, public hospitals and clinics, provincial roads, housing delivery (within the national policy framework), ambulance services, libraries, liquor licences, and oversight of municipalities in their province.

Municipal government is responsible for water reticulation (local pipes to your tap), electricity distribution (from the grid to your meter), refuse removal and solid waste, local roads and stormwater drainage, local land-use planning and building regulations, municipal health services and environmental health, firefighting services, local public transport, and cemeteries, parks, and local amenities.

**Question 2: Which specific department, entity, or official is responsible within that sphere?**

Once you know the sphere, identify the specific department. For national functions, this means the relevant national department and its minister. For provincial functions, this means the provincial department and its MEC. For municipal functions, this means the relevant municipal department, the municipal manager (the most senior administrative official), and the mayor and councillors (the political leadership).

**Question 3: What performance data is available for that department or entity?**

The Auditor-General of South Africa (AGSA) audits every government department and municipality annually. These audit reports are public and available at agsa.co.za. The Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation (DPME) publishes performance assessments of national and provincial departments through the Management Performance Assessment Tool (MPAT). Municipal financial and performance data is available through the National Treasury's municipal data portal and AGSA's municipal audit reports.

With these three questions—which sphere, which department, what does the data say—you have a framework for turning frustration into informed accountability. You are no longer shouting into the void. You are directing your energy at the specific officials who have the constitutional responsibility, the budget allocation, and the performance record that you can scrutinise.

In the next article in this series, *Who Does What*, we will go deeper into the specific departments and officials within each sphere, giving you an even more detailed map of who is responsible for what.

## Where to Go From Here

You now understand the basic architecture of the South African state—three constitutionally equal spheres, each with protected powers, connected by cooperative governance mechanisms, funded through a centralised fiscal transfer system. You understand that the Constitution assigns different functions to different spheres, that money flows from national to provincial to municipal through DORA, and that the intervention mechanisms for when things go wrong are blunt instruments with a poor track record. You understand that the system's failures are primarily implementation failures, not design failures. And you have a practical framework—three questions—for tracing accountability when services fail.

This is the foundation for everything that follows in this series. In *Who Does What*, we will drill down into the specific departments and officials within each sphere. In *Following the Money*, we will trace exactly how your tax money moves through the system and where it gets lost. In *Who Watches the Watchers*, we will explore the oversight and accountability ecosystem—the Auditor-General, the Public Protector, Parliament's portfolio committees, and the courts—that is supposed to hold all of this together.

The architecture of the state is not complicated. It is simply not taught. Now that you understand it, you can begin to navigate the system with precision rather than frustration—and that is the first step toward making it work better.
