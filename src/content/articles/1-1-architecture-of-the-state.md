## Introduction

South Africa's Constitution doesn't just establish a democracy — it designs an entire system of governance. That system is built on a principle most citizens never think about: **three spheres of government**, each with distinct powers and responsibilities.

Understanding this architecture is the first step to making sense of everything else — who is responsible when services fail, where your tax money goes, and how to hold the right people accountable.

## The Three Spheres

The Constitution establishes three "spheres" of government — not "levels" or "tiers." This word choice matters.

:::expert
The term "spheres" was deliberately chosen over "tiers" or "levels" to emphasise that national, provincial, and municipal government are **distinctive, interdependent, and interrelated** — not hierarchical. See Chapter 3 of the Constitution.

### National Government

National government is responsible for matters that affect the country as a whole: defence, foreign affairs, higher education, and the overarching policy framework.

### Provincial Government

South Africa's nine provinces each have their own legislature and executive. They handle education (schools), health (hospitals and clinics), housing, and provincial roads.

### Municipal Government

There are 257 municipalities responsible for the services you interact with daily: water, electricity, refuse removal, local roads, and town planning.

:::takeaway
When your water stops running, your municipality is responsible — not the president. When a hospital is failing, look to your provincial government.
:::

## Why This Matters

Without understanding this basic architecture, citizens direct their frustrations at the wrong sphere of government. This wastes energy and lets the actually responsible officials off the hook.

:::framework
**The Accountability Framework:** For any government service failure, ask three questions: (1) Which sphere is constitutionally responsible? (2) Which specific department or entity delivers it? (3) Who leads that department?
:::

## Conclusion

The architecture of the South African state is not complicated — it is simply not taught. Once you understand the three spheres, you can begin to navigate the system with precision rather than frustration.

In the next article, we'll look at exactly **who does what** within each sphere.
