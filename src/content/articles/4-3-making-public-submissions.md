## Your Voice on Paper

In *Your Right to Participate*, you learned that the Constitution requires the National Assembly, the NCOP, and every provincial legislature to facilitate public involvement in their legislative processes—and that the Constitutional Court has struck down legislation when this obligation was not met. In *Ward Committees and Community Engagement*, you learned how to participate in municipal planning and budgeting at the local level. This article completes Part 4 by giving you something the first two articles deliberately held back: the practical, step-by-step mechanics of making a written submission on draft legislation, regulations, budgets, and policy documents at the national and provincial level.

Here is why this matters. Every year, Parliament and the nine provincial legislatures consider dozens of bills, hundreds of regulations, and numerous policy documents that shape the rules governing your life—from tax law to health regulation, from education policy to environmental standards, from labour law to data protection. Every one of these processes includes, by constitutional requirement, an opportunity for you to comment. And every one of these processes is dominated by a small number of organised participants—industry bodies, professional associations, law firms, and civil society organisations—because most citizens do not know how the process works or believe their voice will not count.

This article changes that. It teaches you how to find out when comment opportunities arise, how to read the documents you are commenting on, how to structure a submission that committee members will actually read, how to present oral testimony if you choose to, and what happens after you submit. You do not need to be a lawyer, an expert, or a member of an organisation. You need a concern, a pen (or keyboard), and this guide.

## Finding the Opportunities: How to Know When to Comment

The most common reason people do not make public submissions is not that they do not care. It is that they do not know a comment opportunity exists. Government publishes calls for comment through channels that most citizens never see. Knowing where to look is the first skill you need.

### The Parliamentary Monitoring Group (PMG)

The Parliamentary Monitoring Group (www.pmg.org.za) is the single most useful resource for tracking parliamentary and provincial legislative activities. PMG is an independent organisation that monitors committee meetings across Parliament and some provincial legislatures. Its website publishes committee meeting schedules, calls for public comment on bills and policy documents, meeting reports summarising what happened in committee sessions, and submission deadlines. PMG also sends email alerts to subscribers—you can sign up for free alerts on specific committees or topics that interest you.

If you use only one tool from this article, make it PMG. Checking the PMG website weekly—or subscribing to its email alerts—will keep you informed of every significant public comment opportunity at the national level.

### Parliament's Website

Parliament's official website (www.parliament.gov.za) publishes committee programmes, calls for public submissions, and information about public hearings. The site can be difficult to navigate, but the key section is the committee programme, which lists upcoming committee meetings and indicates which meetings will involve public hearings or consideration of public submissions. The National Assembly and NCOP each publish their own committee programmes.

### The Government Gazette

The Government Gazette is the official publication of the South African government. Draft bills, proposed regulations, and calls for public comment on policy documents are published in the Gazette. The Gazette is available online (www.gpwonline.co.za) and can be searched by date or keyword. The limitation is that the Gazette is a dense, technical publication—reading it is not a practical monitoring strategy for most citizens. But if you are tracking a specific bill or regulation, the Gazette is the authoritative source for the official text and the submission deadline.

### Department Websites

National and provincial government departments publish draft policies, regulations, and strategic plans on their websites, often with calls for public comment. If you have a specific area of interest—health, education, environment, labour, trade—check the relevant department's website periodically. The quality of department websites varies enormously: some publish comprehensive information with clear calls for comment; others are outdated and poorly maintained.

### Provincial Legislature Websites

Each of the nine provincial legislatures has a website that publishes committee schedules and, in some cases, calls for public submissions on provincial bills. The quality and accessibility of these websites varies—the Western Cape Provincial Parliament and the Gauteng Provincial Legislature tend to have the most functional websites, while smaller provinces may have limited online presence. PMG tracks some provincial committee activities, but coverage is less comprehensive than for national Parliament.

### Civil Society Alerts

Several civil society organisations circulate alerts when important legislation or policy is open for comment. Section27, the Centre for Environmental Rights, the Centre for Child Law, Equal Education, and other organisations routinely alert their networks to comment opportunities in their respective sectors. Following these organisations on social media or subscribing to their newsletters can keep you informed of the comment opportunities that matter most.

:::takeaway
The most reliable way to track public comment opportunities is through the Parliamentary Monitoring Group (www.pmg.org.za). Supplement PMG with Parliament's own website, the Government Gazette for specific bills and regulations, relevant department websites, provincial legislature websites, and civil society organisation alerts. The key is to check regularly—comment periods are typically 21 to 30 days, and if you miss the deadline, the opportunity is gone.
:::

## What You Can Comment On: Types of Documents

Not all public comment opportunities are the same. Understanding the different types of documents that invite public input helps you decide where to focus your effort and how to structure your response.

### Bills (Draft Legislation)

A bill is a proposed law. Before a bill becomes an Act of Parliament, it must pass through a committee process that includes public participation. Bills may be introduced by a cabinet minister (in which case they are typically drafted by the relevant department and approved by cabinet before introduction) or by an individual member of Parliament (a private member's bill, which is less common).

When a bill is referred to a parliamentary committee, the committee typically publishes a call for written submissions and may schedule public hearings. The call specifies the submission deadline, the format for submissions (usually email or postal address), and sometimes the specific issues on which the committee is seeking input. Bills are published in the Government Gazette and are available on Parliament's website.

Bills are the highest-impact comment opportunity. A bill, once enacted, becomes binding law. If a problematic provision makes it through the committee process without being challenged, it becomes entrenched in the statute book and can only be changed by amending legislation—a process that may take years. Catching problems at the bill stage is far more efficient than trying to fix them after enactment.

### Regulations and Subordinate Legislation

Ministers and departments issue regulations under the authority of existing Acts of Parliament. Regulations fill in the operational detail that the Act itself does not specify—for example, an Act may require environmental impact assessments, while the regulations specify exactly what the assessment must contain, who must conduct it, and how it must be submitted. Regulations have the force of law and can have significant practical consequences.

Draft regulations are typically published in the Government Gazette with a call for public comment. The comment period for regulations is often 30 days, though it can be shorter or longer depending on the enabling Act. Regulations receive far less public attention than bills, but they often have a more direct impact on your daily life—because they contain the operational rules that determine how government programmes, licensing systems, and regulatory frameworks actually function.

### Green Papers and White Papers

A Green Paper is a government discussion document that sets out policy options on a specific issue and invites public debate. It is typically published before the government has settled on a policy position and represents an early opportunity to influence policy direction. A White Paper is a more definitive statement of government policy—it sets out the policy that the government intends to pursue and typically serves as the basis for subsequent legislation. White Papers are also published for public comment, but the window for influence is narrower because the policy direction has already been determined.

Green Papers and White Papers are important because they shape the legislation that follows. If you engage with a Green Paper on health policy, your input may influence the policy framework that eventually becomes a health bill. Engaging at the policy stage—before the bill is drafted—can be more effective than engaging at the bill stage, because the policy options are still open.

### Strategic Plans and Annual Performance Plans

National and provincial government departments publish five-year strategic plans and annual performance plans (APPs) that set out their priorities, targets, and performance indicators. These documents are tabled in Parliament and considered by the relevant portfolio committees. While these are not legislation, the committee consideration process provides an opportunity for public input—you can submit written comments to the portfolio committee when it considers a department's strategic plan or APP.

This channel is particularly useful if your concern is about how a department is implementing existing policy rather than about the policy itself. If a provincial education department's APP sets targets that you believe are inadequate—or if its strategic plan omits priorities that you believe are essential—the committee consideration process is the opportunity to raise this.

### The National Budget and Medium Term Budget Policy Statement

The annual national budget and the Medium Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS) are both considered by the Standing Committee on Finance and the Standing Committee on Appropriations. These committees hold public hearings during the budget process—typically after the Minister of Finance tables the budget in February (for the main budget) or in October (for the MTBPS). Budget submissions are a specific type of public comment: they address how national resources should be allocated across government priorities.

Budget submissions require some technical understanding of the budget structure, but you do not need to be an economist to make one. If you believe a specific programme is underfunded, if you have evidence that a particular allocation is not producing results, or if you want to argue for a shift in spending priorities, the budget hearing process is the channel.

## Anatomy of an Effective Submission

Not all submissions are equal. A well-structured submission that addresses the specific provisions of a bill, presents evidence, and makes clear recommendations has far more impact than a vague expression of support or opposition. Committee members and their research staff read hundreds of submissions on major bills. Your submission needs to stand out—not through length or rhetoric, but through clarity, specificity, and substance.

### Structure

An effective submission follows a clear structure that makes it easy for the reader to understand your position, your reasoning, and your recommendations.

**Header.** Identify the document you are commenting on (the bill name and number, the regulation reference, or the policy document title), the committee to which you are submitting, your name (or organisation name), your contact details, and the date.

**Introduction.** In one or two paragraphs, state who you are, why you are submitting (how the proposed legislation or policy affects you, your community, or your area of expertise), and your overall position (support, opposition, or conditional support with recommended amendments).

**Specific comments.** This is the core of your submission. Address the specific provisions of the document—clause by clause if you are commenting on a bill, or section by section if commenting on a policy document. For each provision you address, state the clause or section number, describe the current text, explain your concern or recommendation, and provide your reasoning. If you are proposing an amendment, suggest specific alternative wording where possible.

**Conclusion and recommendations.** Summarise your key recommendations in a numbered list. This makes it easy for committee members to see, at a glance, what you are asking for.

### Tone

Committee members respond to submissions that are respectful, factual, and constructive. Submissions that are angry, abusive, or threatening are counterproductive—they are less likely to be read carefully and may be dismissed entirely. You can be forceful and direct without being disrespectful. "This clause will cause significant harm to small businesses because..." is forceful and factual. "This clause is an outrage and whoever drafted it should be fired" is emotional and unpersuasive.

Avoid political rhetoric. Committee members have party positions; they do not need yours. Focus on the substance: what does the provision do, who does it affect, what are the consequences, and what would be better? Evidence-based submissions that identify practical problems and propose workable solutions are the ones that change minds and change legislation.

### Evidence

The strongest submissions are supported by evidence. If you are arguing that a provision will harm small businesses, cite data on the number of small businesses affected and the estimated cost of compliance. If you are arguing that a health regulation will improve patient safety, cite research on the outcomes associated with the proposed measures. If you are drawing on personal experience—as a healthcare worker, a teacher, a small business owner, a community leader—describe your experience specifically and explain how the proposed legislation will affect your work or your community.

You do not need academic citations to make an effective submission. Personal testimony—"I am a nurse at a rural clinic in Limpopo, and this regulation will require my facility to do X, which we cannot do because Y"—is powerful evidence because it provides the committee with a concrete, real-world perspective that they may not have considered. The combination of personal experience and factual specificity is one of the most effective submission styles.

:::expert
The Parliamentary Monitoring Group, in its capacity-building work with civil society organisations and community groups, has analysed what distinguishes effective public submissions from those that have little or no impact on legislative outcomes. PMG's analysis, drawing on decades of monitoring committee proceedings and tracking the relationship between public input and legislative amendments, identifies several patterns. First, submissions that address specific clauses of a bill—identifying the clause number, explaining the concern, and proposing alternative wording—are significantly more likely to result in committee amendments than submissions that express general support or opposition. Second, submissions from individuals or organisations that also appear at oral hearings have greater impact than written-only submissions, because the oral hearing allows committee members to ask clarifying questions and engage with the substance of the concern. Third, submissions that are coordinated—multiple organisations or individuals raising the same concern from different perspectives—create more pressure than isolated submissions, because they demonstrate breadth of concern. Fourth, submissions that are submitted on time are considered; late submissions are typically not. PMG's practical recommendation is that even a short, focused submission on one or two specific clauses is more valuable than a long, unfocused submission that addresses the entire bill in general terms. Quality and specificity matter more than length.

## Step by Step: Writing Your First Submission

If you have never made a public submission before, the process can feel intimidating. It is not. Here is a step-by-step guide that takes you from finding the opportunity to pressing send.

### Step 1: Find the Call for Comment

Check PMG, Parliament's website, the Government Gazette, or the relevant department's website for the call for public comment. The call will specify the document being commented on, the submission deadline, and the address or email for submissions. Note the deadline immediately—mark it on your calendar with a reminder at least one week before.

### Step 2: Get the Document

Download the bill, regulation, or policy document. These are typically available as PDFs from Parliament's website, the Government Gazette, or the department's website. PMG often provides direct links to the relevant documents alongside the call for comment.

### Step 3: Read the Document — or the Relevant Parts

You do not need to read every word of a long bill to make a meaningful submission. Start with the memorandum of objects—a summary, typically attached to the bill, that explains the bill's purpose and the rationale for each provision. This gives you the overview. Then read the specific clauses that relate to your concern. If you are a healthcare worker commenting on a health bill, focus on the clauses that affect healthcare delivery. If you are a small business owner commenting on a regulatory bill, focus on the compliance and licensing provisions. The table of contents and the memorandum of objects will help you identify the relevant sections.

If the document is technically complex and you are struggling to understand it, check whether any civil society organisation has published a plain-language summary or analysis. Organisations like Section27, the Centre for Environmental Rights, SECTION27, the Helen Suzman Foundation, and others regularly publish accessible analyses of important bills.

### Step 4: Identify Your Concerns

As you read, note the specific provisions that concern you—whether because they will cause harm, because they are ambiguous, because they omit something important, or because they could be improved. Write down the clause or section number, the issue, and your initial thinking about what should change.

### Step 5: Draft Your Submission

Using the structure described above, draft your submission. Start with the header (document name, committee, your details, date). Write a brief introduction stating who you are and why you are submitting. Then address each of your specific concerns in order, referencing the relevant clause or section. For each concern, explain the problem and, where possible, propose a solution—specific alternative wording, an additional provision, or the deletion of a problematic clause. Close with a numbered list of recommendations.

### Step 6: Review

Before submitting, review your draft for clarity, accuracy, and tone. Ask yourself: if I were a committee member reading this for the first time, would I understand the concern? Would I know what action to take? Is the tone respectful and constructive? If possible, ask someone else to read your draft—a friend, a colleague, a family member—and tell you whether your argument is clear.

### Step 7: Submit

Send your submission to the address specified in the call for comment. If submitting by email, use a clear subject line: "Written Submission on [Bill Name/Number] — [Your Name or Organisation]." Attach your submission as a PDF or Word document, and include a brief cover note in the body of the email. If submitting by post, use registered mail to ensure delivery and keep the proof of posting. Keep a copy of everything you submit, including the email confirmation or postal receipt.

### Step 8: Consider Requesting to Present Orally

If the committee is holding public hearings—which is typical for major bills—you can request to make an oral presentation in addition to your written submission. The request is usually made in writing, either as part of your written submission or in a separate communication to the committee secretary. If your request is accepted, you will be allocated a time slot—typically 10 to 20 minutes—to present your submission and answer committee members' questions.

## Presenting Oral Testimony

An oral presentation to a parliamentary or provincial legislature committee is a more direct and often more impactful form of participation than a written submission alone. It puts you in the room with the decision-makers, allows them to engage with your concerns in real time, and gives your submission a human face that a written document cannot provide.

### Preparing Your Presentation

Distil your written submission into the key points you can present in 10 to 15 minutes. Committee members have read (or should have read) your written submission before the hearing. Your oral presentation should not repeat the entire written document—it should highlight the most important points, explain them in accessible language, and give the committee members a clear sense of your central concern and your recommended solution.

Prepare notes or a brief slide presentation if the committee permits it. Practice your presentation to ensure it fits within the allocated time. Anticipate the questions committee members are likely to ask—particularly about the practical implications of your recommendations and about the evidence supporting your claims.

### What to Expect in the Committee Room

The committee will be chaired by the committee chairperson, who manages the proceedings. Committee members sit around a table or in a horseshoe arrangement. Presenters are typically seated at a table facing the committee or at a podium. Proceedings are usually recorded—by Hansard (the official parliamentary record), by PMG, or both.

You will be introduced, invited to present, and then asked questions by committee members. The questions may be probing—committee members may challenge your evidence, question your recommendations, or test whether your position is consistent. This is not adversarial; it is the committee's way of testing the strength of your argument. Answer honestly and directly. If you do not know the answer to a question, say so—"I do not have that specific data, but I can provide it to the committee in writing after the hearing" is a perfectly acceptable response. Never fabricate evidence or overstate your expertise.

### Provincial Legislature Hearings

Provincial legislature committee hearings follow a similar format, though the scale is smaller. Provincial committees consider provincial bills and oversee provincial department performance. If a provincial bill or policy affects your life—a provincial health regulation, a provincial planning framework, a provincial education policy—you can submit written comments and request to present orally, following the same process described above. Contact the relevant committee through the provincial legislature's website or through PMG if it covers the province.

Provincial hearings tend to receive even fewer public submissions than national ones—which means your submission has a proportionally greater impact. In a national process, your submission may be one of hundreds. In a provincial process, it may be one of a dozen. The marginal impact of your participation is higher at the provincial level precisely because fewer people participate.

## Commenting on Regulations

Regulations—subordinate legislation issued by ministers under the authority of existing Acts—are one of the most underappreciated comment opportunities. Regulations determine the operational detail of how laws work in practice, and they often have a more direct impact on your daily life than the parent Act.

### How the Process Works

When a minister proposes new regulations or amendments to existing regulations, the draft regulations are typically published in the Government Gazette with a notice inviting public comment within a specified period (usually 30 days, though the enabling Act may specify a different period). The notice includes the text of the proposed regulations and the address for submissions.

The process for commenting on regulations is essentially the same as for bills: read the draft, identify your concerns, draft a submission addressing specific regulation provisions, and submit before the deadline. The key difference is that regulations are issued by the executive (the minister and department), not by the legislature. Your submission goes to the department, not to a parliamentary committee. The department is required to consider submissions, but the minister makes the final decision on the regulations—there is no parliamentary vote.

### Why Regulation Submissions Matter

Regulations receive far fewer public submissions than bills—often only a handful, primarily from industry participants and specialist civil society organisations. This means that the regulatory process is particularly vulnerable to capture by organised interests: if only the mining industry comments on mining regulations, or only the banking sector comments on financial regulations, the resulting rules will reflect those interests disproportionately. Your submission—as a citizen, a community member, or a person affected by the regulation—provides a counterweight to organised industry input.

Regulations also change more frequently than Acts. A minister can amend regulations relatively quickly—far more quickly than the legislative process required to amend an Act. This means that problematic regulations can be changed if there is sufficient public pressure, and that opportunities to comment on regulatory amendments arise regularly.

## The National Budget: A Specific Submission Opportunity

The national budget process offers a structured opportunity for public input that most citizens do not know about. Two committees—the Standing Committee on Finance and the Standing Committee on Appropriations—hold public hearings during the budget cycle.

### The Medium Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS)

The Minister of Finance tables the MTBPS in October each year. The MTBPS sets out the fiscal framework for the next three years—the economic outlook, revenue projections, expenditure ceilings, and the deficit target. The Standing Committee on Finance holds hearings on the MTBPS, typically in November, and invites public submissions. This is your opportunity to comment on the overall fiscal direction—whether the government is spending too much or too little, whether the deficit target is appropriate, whether specific sectors need more resources.

### The Main Budget

The main budget, tabled in February, translates the MTBPS framework into specific departmental allocations. The Appropriations Committee holds hearings on the Appropriation Bill and the Division of Revenue Bill—the legislation that authorises government spending and divides revenue among the three spheres. These hearings are the opportunity to comment on specific allocation decisions: whether the education budget is adequate, whether the health conditional grant is sufficient, whether the local government equitable share formula needs adjustment.

### The Fiscal Framework and Revenue Proposals

The Standing Committee on Finance also considers the fiscal framework and revenue proposals (tax changes) announced in the budget. If you have a view on proposed tax changes—VAT adjustments, income tax bracket changes, excise duties, carbon tax—the fiscal framework hearings are the place to raise it.

Budget submissions require some understanding of how the budget is structured. If you have read Article 2.2 (*The Budget Process*) in this series, you have the foundation you need. Focus your submission on the specific programme or allocation that concerns you, provide evidence for your position, and propose a clear recommendation.

## What Happens After You Submit

Understanding what happens to your submission after you press send helps you set realistic expectations and know when to follow up.

### Written Submissions

Your written submission is received by the committee secretary (for parliamentary submissions) or the department (for regulatory submissions). For parliamentary committees, submissions are compiled, summarised, and distributed to committee members—usually as a summary document that extracts the key points from each submission, organised by theme or by clause. Committee members may read the full submissions or rely on the summary, depending on the volume of submissions and the member's diligence.

During the committee's deliberation on the bill, members may refer to specific submissions—particularly those that raise issues the committee had not previously considered or that provide evidence supporting a proposed amendment. If your submission raises a point that resonates with a committee member, that member may propose an amendment based on your input. The amendment must be debated and voted on by the committee.

You will not typically receive individual feedback on your submission—the committee does not write back to each submitter explaining how their input was considered. This is one of the frustrations of the submission process: you submit, and then you hear nothing. The way to track your submission's impact is to monitor the committee's proceedings through PMG, which reports on committee deliberations and records when submissions are referenced. If the committee adopts an amendment that addresses your concern, you will see it in the committee report and in the amended bill.

### Oral Presentations

If you present orally, your impact is more visible. Committee members' questions indicate which aspects of your presentation they found relevant. The committee discussion following your presentation may reference your points. PMG's committee meeting report will record your presentation and the committee's response.

### When Your Submission Is Ignored

It happens. Committees receive submissions and do not address the concerns raised. Departments receive comments on draft regulations and adopt the regulations unchanged. This is frustrating—but it does not mean your submission was wasted. Your submission is on the record. If the legislation or regulation produces the problems you predicted, your submission is evidence that the legislature or department was warned. Civil society organisations, researchers, and journalists access submission records and can use your documented concern to build accountability cases after the fact.

If you believe the committee failed to adequately consider public submissions—particularly if the committee held no hearings, or conducted hearings that were insufficient given the significance of the legislation—the *Doctors for Life* and *LAMOSA* jurisprudence (discussed in Article 4.1) provides a legal basis for challenging the legislation on participation grounds. This is a legal avenue that requires resources and expertise—typically pursued by civil society organisations rather than individuals—but it is available.

:::expert
The Centre for Environmental Rights (CER), a public interest law organisation that specialises in environmental governance and participatory rights, has extensive practical experience with the public submission process across all levels of government. CER's work—documented in their annual *Full Disclosure* reports on corporate environmental transparency and in their published submission guides—provides insight into what makes submissions effective at scale. CER's experience shows that coordinated submission campaigns, where multiple organisations and individuals submit on the same bill or regulation with aligned but distinct perspectives, produce the greatest legislative impact. When a parliamentary committee receives submissions from a legal organisation identifying constitutional concerns, a community organisation describing lived experience of the affected issue, a scientific body providing technical evidence, and individual citizens expressing personal impact—all addressing the same clause of the same bill—the cumulative weight of those submissions creates accountability pressure that a single submission, however well-crafted, cannot. CER has also documented the specific challenge of regulatory submissions: departments receive far fewer public comments on draft regulations than parliamentary committees receive on bills, which means that regulatory processes are disproportionately shaped by the industry participants who submit consistently. CER's practical recommendation is that citizens and civil society organisations should invest as much effort in regulatory submissions as in parliamentary submissions—because regulations often have a more direct and immediate impact on people's lives than the parent Acts.

## A Model Submission Structure

To make the guidance in this article concrete, here is a model structure for a written submission on a bill. You can adapt this structure for regulations, policy documents, and other comment opportunities.

**[Your name / Organisation name]**
**[Your address / email / phone]**
**[Date]**

**To:** The Chairperson, [Committee Name]
**Re:** Written Submission on the [Bill Name and Number]

**1. Introduction**

[One to two paragraphs. State who you are. Explain why you are submitting—how the bill affects you, your community, or your area of knowledge. State your overall position: do you support the bill, oppose it, or support it with specific amendments?]

**2. Specific Comments**

**2.1 Clause [X]: [Short description of the clause's subject]**

[Explain the clause's current text or effect. Identify your concern—what problem does this clause create, who does it affect, and what evidence supports your concern? Propose a recommendation: amend, delete, or add alternative wording. If proposing alternative wording, provide the specific text.]

**2.2 Clause [Y]: [Short description]**

[Same structure as above.]

[Continue for each clause you wish to address.]

**3. Summary of Recommendations**

1. [Recommendation 1 — specific, actionable]
2. [Recommendation 2]
3. [Recommendation 3]

**4. Request for Oral Presentation** *(optional)*

[If you wish to present orally, state your request here and briefly explain what additional perspective you would bring beyond the written submission.]

This structure is not mandatory—committees do not prescribe a format for submissions—but it is effective because it is clear, organised, and makes your recommendations easy to identify and act on.

## Provincial Submissions: The Overlooked Opportunity

Provincial legislature submissions follow the same basic process as national parliamentary submissions, but they receive even less public attention—which paradoxically makes them a higher-impact participation opportunity for individual citizens.

Provincial legislatures consider provincial bills, oversee provincial departments, and approve provincial budgets. When a provincial legislature committee considers a provincial bill or reviews a department's performance, the process includes a call for public submissions—though the publicity given to these calls is often minimal. Provincial legislatures tend to have smaller, less active committee systems than the national Parliament, and public submissions on provincial processes are rare. A single, well-crafted submission on a provincial bill may receive more individual attention from committee members than a submission on a high-profile national bill that competes with hundreds of others.

To track provincial legislative processes, check your provincial legislature's website and monitor PMG's provincial coverage. Build a relationship with your MPL (Member of the Provincial Legislature)—the provincial equivalent of an MP. If you regularly submit comments on provincial legislative processes, you will become a known participant, and your inputs will carry the accumulated credibility of sustained engagement.

Provincial budget processes also offer submission opportunities. When the provincial MEC for Finance tables the provincial budget, the provincial legislature's finance committee considers it—and this consideration should include a public participation process. If you have followed the earlier articles in this series on provincial government (Articles 3.1 and 3.2), you understand what provincial budgets fund and what to look for. A submission that identifies a specific concern about provincial education or health spending—grounded in your experience as a parent, a patient, a teacher, or a community member—provides the finance committee with practical perspective that departmental briefings may not.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

Having covered what makes submissions effective, here are the most common mistakes that reduce a submission's impact—and how to avoid them.

**Submitting late.** Deadlines are hard deadlines. A submission that arrives after the closing date will not be considered. Mark the deadline, build in a buffer, and submit at least two days early to account for email delays or postal issues.

**Being too general.** "We oppose this bill because it is bad for the country" tells the committee nothing actionable. Address specific provisions and explain why they are problematic. The more specific your submission, the more useful it is to committee members who are deciding which clauses to amend.

**Being too long.** A 50-page submission on a bill with 30 clauses will not be read in full. Committee research staff will extract key points, but the nuance may be lost. Aim for conciseness: a focused submission of 3 to 10 pages that addresses your most important concerns clearly is more effective than an exhaustive document that tries to address everything.

**Attacking people instead of provisions.** Committee members discount submissions that attack individuals—the minister, the drafters, other submitters. Focus on the text of the bill or regulation and the consequences of the provisions. The question is not who drafted a problematic clause but what the clause does and how it should be improved.

**Omitting recommendations.** A submission that identifies problems without proposing solutions is less useful than one that offers concrete alternatives. Even if your proposed solution is not adopted, it demonstrates that you have thought constructively about the issue and gives the committee something to work with.

**Not following up.** After submitting, track the committee's proceedings. If your concern was not addressed and you have an opportunity to present orally, use it. If the committee adopts the bill without addressing your concern, and the bill returns to the full House for debate, consider engaging with individual MPs or your constituency MP to raise the issue at the plenary stage.

## Participation Compounds

A single submission may or may not change a law. But participation compounds. The first time you submit, you learn the process. The second time, you know where to find the documents, how to structure your response, and who to contact. By the third or fourth time, you are a known participant in the process—committee staff recognise your name, your submissions have a track record, and your inputs carry the credibility of sustained engagement. Over time, you may connect with other citizens and organisations who share your concerns, and your individual voice becomes part of a collective one.

The public submission process is the most concrete expression of the constitutional promise that you are not merely a voter—you are a participant in the governance of your country. Every bill, every regulation, every budget that passes through Parliament without your input is a decision made in your name but without your voice. This article has given you the tools to add your voice. The next article in this series will give you the tools to evaluate whether government is spending your money responsibly—by teaching you how to read the Auditor-General's reports.
