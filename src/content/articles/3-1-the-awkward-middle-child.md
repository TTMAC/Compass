## Why Your Province Is the Most Misunderstood Part of South African Government

South Africa's nine provinces sit in the most structurally awkward position in the entire governance system. They are constitutionally powerful on paper—Schedule 4 of the Constitution assigns them concurrent authority over education, health, housing, agriculture, and a dozen other critical functions. Schedule 5 gives them exclusive control over ambulance services, provincial roads, liquor licences, and libraries. They employ the teachers who educate your children and the nurses who staff your local clinic. They absorb the largest single share of nationally raised revenue—approximately R756 billion in the 2024/25 financial year, according to the Division of Revenue Act (DORA). By any measure, provincial government is where the bulk of South Africa's public services live.

And yet, provinces are fiscally dependent, politically overshadowed, and persistently misunderstood. They raise less than 5% of their own revenue. They have almost no independent tax base. They depend almost entirely on transfers from National Treasury—transfers whose size, timing, and conditions are determined in Pretoria, not in the provincial capital. They implement national policy frameworks they did not design, under spending conditions they did not set, and are held accountable by a national Auditor-General whose audit cycle shapes their administrative behaviour more than their own legislatures do. When things go wrong—when schools run out of textbooks, when clinics run out of medicine, when provincial roads deteriorate—the blame falls inconsistently on premiers, MECs, national ministers, or "the government" in general, because most citizens have no clear mental model for what provincial government actually does, what it controls, and what it cannot control. This article gives you that mental model.

## How South Africa Ended Up With Nine Provinces

The existence of provinces was one of the most fiercely contested issues in the constitutional negotiations of 1993–1996. The African National Congress, drawing on its centralised liberation movement tradition and its deep distrust of the apartheid government's Bantustan system, initially favoured a unitary state with no provinces at all. Strong regional government, in the ANC's view, risked entrenching the ethnic homelands that apartheid had created and fragmenting the new democratic state. The Inkatha Freedom Party, rooted in its KwaZulu base, pushed hard for a federal model with strong provincial powers—including the right to draft provincial constitutions. The National Party, anticipating that it would lose national power but might retain control of the Western Cape, also favoured strong provinces as a counterweight to national government.

The compromise was a system that satisfied none of these positions fully but gave each something. South Africa would have provinces—nine of them—but their powers would be limited, their fiscal autonomy almost non-existent, and the national government would retain the ability to override provincial legislation on concurrent matters under specific circumstances. The provinces would not be federal states. They would not have their own tax systems. They would not control their own police forces. But they would have constitutionally protected functions, their own elected legislatures, and their own executive authorities.

The nine boundaries themselves were drawn by the Commission on the Demarcation of Provinces, Regions and Local Authorities, and reflected a mix of practical, historical, and political considerations. Gauteng, the economic heartland, was carved out around the Johannesburg-Pretoria-Vereeniging metropolitan complex. KwaZulu-Natal merged the former KwaZulu homeland with the colonial province of Natal. The Eastern Cape absorbed the former Transkei and Ciskei homelands into a single province. Limpopo combined the former Venda, Lebowa, and Gazankulu homelands with parts of the former Northern Transvaal. The Northern Cape, the largest province by land area, was sparsely populated and economically thin from the start.

These boundaries have endured unchanged since 1994, despite persistent questions about whether all nine provinces are governable entities. The Northern Cape spans 372,889 square kilometres—larger than Germany—but has a population of approximately 1.3 million. The Free State's economic base has contracted as mining declined. Several provinces were created by merging apartheid-era homelands with adjacent white-administered areas, inheriting the deep institutional capacity gaps that the homeland system had produced. The provinces that absorbed the most homeland territory—the Eastern Cape, Limpopo, KwaZulu-Natal, and the North West—have, three decades later, consistently the weakest governance outcomes. This is not coincidental. The institutional inheritance of the homeland system—underfunded bureaucracies, politicised administrations, poor infrastructure, limited professional capacity—has proven remarkably persistent.

:::takeaway
South Africa's nine provinces were a political compromise between those who wanted a unitary state and those who wanted a federation. The result is a system that is neither—provinces have constitutional powers but almost no fiscal autonomy. The boundaries drawn in 1994, many incorporating former apartheid homelands, created provinces with vastly different institutional starting points. Three decades later, the provinces that inherited the most homeland territory still have the weakest governance outcomes.

## What Provinces Can Actually Do: The Constitutional Powers

The Constitution divides government functions between spheres in two schedules that determine what your provincial government is constitutionally empowered to do. Understanding these schedules is essential because they define the boundaries of provincial responsibility—and therefore the boundaries of provincial accountability.

Schedule 4 lists concurrent powers shared between national and provincial government. These are functions where both spheres can legislate, though Section 146 of the Constitution provides that national legislation prevails when there is a conflict, subject to specific conditions. The concurrent functions include agriculture, consumer protection, cultural matters, disaster management, education at all levels excluding universities, environment, health services, housing, indigenous law and customary law, industrial promotion, language policy, nature conservation, pollution control, population development, property transfer fees, public transport, public works, regional planning and development, road traffic regulation, soil conservation, tourism, trade, traditional leadership, urban and rural development, vehicle licensing, and welfare services.

That list is dense, but the practical implication is straightforward: the two largest functions your province performs—education and health—are concurrent. This means national government sets the policy framework, the curriculum, the norms and standards, and the legislative architecture. Your province implements those frameworks, hires the teachers and nurses, builds and maintains the schools and clinics, and manages the day-to-day delivery of these services. When the national Minister of Basic Education announces a new curriculum policy, it is your provincial education department that must train teachers to deliver it, procure the textbooks, and adapt implementation to provincial conditions. When the national Department of Health sets treatment protocols for HIV/AIDS, it is your provincial health department that must ensure your local clinic has the medication, the trained staff, and the cold chain infrastructure to implement them.

Schedule 5, Part A lists functions that are exclusively provincial—meaning only your provincial government can legislate on them. These include abattoirs, ambulance services, archives (other than national archives), libraries (other than national libraries), liquor licences, museums (other than national museums), provincial planning, provincial cultural matters, provincial recreation and amenities, provincial roads and traffic, and veterinary services. These exclusive functions are constitutionally protected, but they are relatively narrow compared to the concurrent functions that dominate provincial budgets.

The practical reality is that education and health together consume roughly 80% of a typical provincial budget, according to National Treasury's annual Provincial Budget and Expenditure Review. Your province's exclusive functions—the ambulance services, the libraries, the liquor licences—are important but small in fiscal terms. Provincial government is, at its core, an education-and-health delivery machine. Everything else is secondary in budgetary terms. This has a direct consequence for how you should evaluate your province: the quality of your schools and your clinics is the single most important measure of whether your provincial government is performing.

## The Structure of Provincial Government: Premier, Executive Council, Legislature, and Administration

Each province has a government structure that mirrors, in miniature, the national government. Understanding who does what within the province is essential to knowing where to direct your questions, complaints, and expectations.

### The Premier

The Premier is the head of the provincial executive. Section 127 of the Constitution vests executive authority in the Premier, who exercises it together with the Members of the Executive Council (MECs). The Premier is elected by the provincial legislature from among its members—which means, in practice, the Premier is the leader of whichever party or coalition commands a majority in the legislature. The Premier appoints MECs, assigns their portfolios, and can reshuffle or dismiss them. The Premier also coordinates the functions of provincial departments and provincial legislation.

The Premier's power is real but constrained. The Premier cannot set policy in areas of concurrent jurisdiction—that is done nationally. The Premier cannot raise taxes—that is done nationally. The Premier cannot unilaterally increase the provincial budget—that is determined through the Division of Revenue process. What the Premier can do is determine how the province organises its administration, how it prioritises within the budget it receives, and how effectively it implements the policy frameworks set by national government. Leadership quality at the premier level therefore matters enormously—but it operates within fiscal and policy constraints that are set elsewhere.

### The Executive Council

The Executive Council is the provincial equivalent of the national Cabinet. It consists of the Premier and the MECs. Each MEC is assigned a portfolio—Education, Health, Finance, Human Settlements, Public Works, Agriculture, and so on—and is politically responsible for the performance of the provincial department in that portfolio. The number of MECs is limited by Section 132 of the Constitution to no more than 10 (the constitutional maximum), and in practice most provinces have between 8 and 10 MECs.

MECs are the political principals of provincial departments. They set departmental priorities within the national policy framework, answer to the provincial legislature during question sessions and budget votes, and bear public responsibility when things go wrong in their portfolios. When your province's matric results decline, the MEC for Education faces public scrutiny. When your local clinic runs out of chronic medication, the MEC for Health is expected to answer.

### The Provincial Legislature

Each province has a unicameral legislature of between 30 and 80 members, depending on the province's population. Gauteng, the most populous province, has the largest legislature. The Northern Cape, the least populous, has the smallest. Members of the Provincial Legislature (MPLs) are elected through a proportional representation system—you vote for a party, and seats are allocated in proportion to each party's share of the vote.

The provincial legislature has three core functions: passing provincial legislation (within the province's constitutional competence), overseeing the provincial executive (through committees, questions, and debates), and approving the provincial budget. The oversight function is, in theory, the legislature's most important role—it is the mechanism through which the citizens' elected representatives hold the Premier and MECs accountable for how they spend public money and deliver services.

In practice, provincial legislatures vary dramatically in their effectiveness. The Western Cape Provincial Parliament and the Gauteng Provincial Legislature have relatively active committee systems, conduct regular oversight visits, and produce substantive reports. Several other provincial legislatures—particularly in smaller and more rural provinces—struggle with capacity: MPLs may lack the technical knowledge to scrutinise complex departmental budgets, committee support staff may be insufficient, and party discipline may prevent backbenchers from holding their own party's executive to account. The standing committees on public accounts (provincial SCOPAs) are supposed to interrogate the Auditor-General's findings on provincial departments, but the quality and intensity of this interrogation varies enormously from province to province.

### The Provincial Administration: HODs and Departments

Below the political layer sits the provincial administration—the permanent bureaucracy that actually delivers services. Each provincial department is headed by a Head of Department (HOD), who is the administrative head and accounting officer. The HOD is responsible for the department's financial management, human resources, and operational performance. HODs are appointed by the Premier on the recommendation of the MEC for the relevant portfolio, through a process that is supposed to involve the Public Service Commission but is, in practice, heavily influenced by political considerations.

The HOD-MEC relationship is one of the most consequential dynamics in provincial governance. A competent HOD working under a supportive MEC can drive significant improvements in departmental performance. A competent HOD working under an interfering or corrupt MEC faces an impossible position—political pressure to deviate from proper process, undermining of administrative authority, and the constant threat of removal. An incompetent HOD, regardless of the MEC, will produce administrative dysfunction that cascades through the entire department. The Auditor-General of South Africa (AGSA) has, in successive annual reports, identified instability in HOD positions—frequent turnover, acting appointments, and vacancies in key positions—as one of the primary drivers of poor provincial governance outcomes.

Professor Nico Steytler, holder of the South African Research Chair in Multilevel Government, Law and Policy at the Dullah Omar Institute, University of the Western Cape, has published extensively on the structural tensions within South Africa's provincial government system. His research, including contributions to the Forum of Federations' comparative analyses of multilevel governance systems, identifies a fundamental design contradiction: the Constitution assigns provinces significant service delivery responsibilities and concurrent legislative powers, but denies them the fiscal instruments to exercise meaningful autonomy. In most federal or quasi-federal systems, subnational governments have at least some independent taxing power—they can raise revenue from their own populations and are therefore fiscally accountable to their own electorates. South African provinces have virtually none. The consequence, Steytler argues, is that provincial governance is structurally oriented upward—toward National Treasury, which controls the resources—rather than downward toward citizens, who receive the services. This creates what he terms an "accountability deficit": provincial governments are accountable to the national government for how they spend national transfers, but they are only weakly accountable to their own citizens for the quality of the services those transfers are supposed to fund. The fiscal structure, not merely individual competence or corruption, shapes the accountability dynamic.

## The Money Problem: Provincial Fiscal Dependence

If you want to understand why provincial government behaves the way it does, start with the money. Provinces raise less than 5% of their own revenue. The remaining 95% or more comes from national government, primarily through the provincial equitable share and conditional grants allocated through the annual Division of Revenue Act.

Provincial own-revenue sources are strikingly limited. Motor vehicle licence fees are the most significant, but they generate only modest amounts—even Gauteng, the province with the most registered vehicles, raises a small fraction of its total budget from licence fees. Gambling taxes and provincial liquor licence fees contribute marginally. Hospital patient fees—charges levied on patients at provincial hospitals based on income—generate some revenue but are operationally difficult to collect and socially sensitive to enforce. The total own revenue of all nine provinces combined typically amounts to approximately R30–35 billion per year, against total provincial budgets that collectively exceed R750 billion. The gap between what provinces spend and what they raise is not a margin—it is the entire budget.

This fiscal dependence is not an accident or a failure. It is a structural feature of the system designed during the constitutional negotiations. The framers chose to centralise revenue collection at the national level through SARS and redistribute it through the DORA formula. The logic was that centralised collection is more efficient (one national tax authority rather than nine provincial ones), that redistribution can address historical inequalities between provinces (poor provinces receive more per capita than wealthy ones), and that national control over spending prevents provincial fiscal indiscipline from undermining macroeconomic stability.

The trade-off is autonomy. A province that does not raise its own money has limited ability to set its own priorities. If the equitable share formula allocates a specific amount for education based on learner numbers, the province can, in theory, spend that money on something else—the equitable share is unconditional. But in practice, the formula's components are calculated to fund specific functions at specific levels, and any province that diverts education funding to, say, roads, will face both political consequences (angry parents and teacher unions) and administrative consequences (National Treasury and AGSA will flag the deviation). The conditional grants—for housing, health infrastructure, roads maintenance—come with explicit spending conditions that the province must comply with or risk having the funding reduced or redirected.

The result is a provincial government that has the constitutional mandate to deliver services but not the fiscal freedom to decide, in any meaningful sense, how much to spend on what. The fiscal framework does that. The province's real discretion lies in how efficiently and effectively it implements the spending plan that the fiscal framework implies. This is not nothing—implementation quality varies enormously between provinces, and that variation determines whether your school has enough teachers and your clinic has enough medicine. But it is a much narrower form of governance than the constitutional text might suggest.

## The Equitable Share: How a Formula Shapes Your Province

The provincial equitable share is the unconditional transfer from national government that forms the backbone of every provincial budget. Understanding how the formula works tells you why your province receives the amount it does—and why some provinces receive more per capita than others.

The formula has several weighted components. The education component, which accounts for approximately 48% of the total formula, is based on the size of the school-age population (ages 5–17) and the number of learners enrolled in public ordinary schools. A province with more school-age children receives a larger education share. The health component, approximately 27% of the formula, is based on the proportion of the population without medical aid—the reasoning being that people without private healthcare depend on the provincial public health system. The basic component, approximately 16%, is based on each province's share of the total national population. Smaller components account for institutional capacity (a base allocation for the administrative machinery of each province), poverty (additional weighting for provinces with higher poverty rates), and economic activity.

The formula creates winners and losers. KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng, the two most populous provinces, receive the largest absolute allocations—each receiving over R100 billion annually. But per capita allocations tell a different story. Provinces with large poor populations and low own-revenue capacity—the Eastern Cape, Limpopo, and the North West—receive higher per capita equitable share allocations than the Western Cape or Gauteng, because the formula is designed to compensate for their greater need and weaker revenue base.

The formula is reviewed periodically by the Financial and Fiscal Commission (FFC), an independent constitutional body established under Section 220 of the Constitution. The FFC makes annual recommendations to Parliament on the equitable division of revenue—both the vertical division (how much each sphere receives in total) and the horizontal division (how it is shared among provinces). The FFC's recommendations are advisory, not binding—the final allocation is a political decision made by the Minister of Finance and approved by Parliament. But the FFC's technical analysis provides the baseline against which the political negotiation occurs.

:::expert
The Financial and Fiscal Commission, in its annual *Submission for the Division of Revenue*, has consistently raised concerns about the gap between the equitable share formula's assumptions and provincial spending realities. The FFC's analysis shows that the education component of the formula is based on learner enrolment numbers, but provincial education spending is driven primarily by personnel costs—teacher salaries, which are determined by national wage agreements negotiated in the Education Labour Relations Council, not by the province. When national wage agreements increase teacher salaries above the rate of growth in the equitable share, provinces face an unfunded mandate: the cost of employing the teachers they already have rises faster than the revenue allocated to fund them. The FFC has documented this fiscal squeeze in successive annual submissions, showing that provinces facing above-inflation wage bill growth have three options, all of them bad: increase class sizes by not replacing departing teachers, cut non-personnel spending (textbooks, maintenance, learner transport), or accumulate unauthorized expenditure (spending more than the budget allows and carrying the deficit forward). The Commission's submissions are publicly available on its website and provide the most detailed independent analysis of the fiscal pressures facing provincial government.

## Nine Provinces, Nine Different Realities

Talking about "provincial government" as if it were a single thing is as misleading as talking about "municipal government" as if the City of Cape Town and a rural municipality in the Eastern Cape were the same institution. South Africa's nine provinces occupy vastly different positions in terms of economic base, institutional capacity, political dynamics, and governance outcomes. Understanding these differences is essential to evaluating any province's performance fairly.

### The Stronger Performers: Western Cape and Gauteng

The Western Cape has, for most of the democratic era, been governed by a party different from the national government—first by the National Party and then by the Democratic Alliance. This political distinctiveness has had a measurable effect on governance: the Western Cape has consistently achieved the strongest provincial AGSA audit outcomes, with the highest proportion of clean audits among its provincial departments. The province benefits from a relatively strong economic base (agriculture, tourism, financial services, and technology), a comparatively well-functioning administration, and the political incentive that comes from governing in opposition—the DA's provincial record is its most visible credential for contesting national power, creating a strong motivation to govern well.

Gauteng, the smallest province by land area but the largest by population and economic output, faces a fundamentally different set of challenges. The province accounts for approximately 34% of national GDP and is home to over 16 million people—the most urbanised province in the country. Gauteng's scale gives it administrative capacity that smaller provinces lack: larger departments, deeper professional staff pools, and a more diverse economic base that generates more own revenue than any other province. But Gauteng's rapid urbanisation also creates pressure: growing demand for health services from an increasing population, expanding informal settlements, and the infrastructure strain that comes from being the country's economic magnet.

### The Middle Ground: KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga, and the Free State

KwaZulu-Natal is the second most populous province, with a complex political landscape shaped by the historical rivalry between the ANC and the Inkatha Freedom Party, significant rural poverty in its interior, and a major metropolitan centre in eThekwini (Durban). The province has pockets of strong institutional capacity—the eThekwini metro is among the better-performing municipalities nationally—but its rural areas face deep service delivery challenges. Its provincial departments have shown mixed audit outcomes, with some improving over time and others persistently flagged by AGSA.

Mpumalanga and the Free State present different versions of the same challenge: provinces with moderate economic bases (mining in Mpumalanga, agriculture and mining in the Free State) that have experienced governance weaknesses disproportionate to their economic position. Both provinces have struggled with irregular expenditure, qualified audit opinions, and political instability in key administrative positions.

### The Persistent Strugglers: Eastern Cape, Limpopo, and North West

The Eastern Cape, Limpopo, and the North West represent the sharpest end of South Africa's provincial governance challenge. All three provinces share a common institutional inheritance: they absorbed significant homeland territory during the 1994 transition. The Eastern Cape incorporated the Transkei and Ciskei. Limpopo incorporated Venda, Lebowa, and Gazankulu. The North West incorporated Bophuthatswana. The administrations of these former homelands were characterised by weak institutional capacity, politicised bureaucracies, poor record-keeping, and infrastructure deficits that the new provincial governments inherited wholesale.

Three decades later, this inheritance has proven stubbornly difficult to overcome. The Eastern Cape has the highest poverty rate of any province (according to Statistics South Africa data) and has faced chronic challenges in education delivery—including the persistent failure to provide adequate school infrastructure in the former homeland areas. Limpopo became the first province to be placed under a comprehensive Section 100(1)(b) intervention in 2011, when national government assumed responsibility for five provincial departments after finding pervasive financial mismanagement, including the Limpopo textbook crisis in which millions of rands' worth of textbooks were not delivered to schools. The North West was placed under a Section 100 intervention in 2018 amid widespread governance collapse, with the then-premier facing allegations of state capture and several departments found to be non-functional.

The variation between provinces is not simply a matter of individual leadership quality—though leadership matters. It is structural. Provinces with stronger economic bases generate more own revenue, attract better-qualified professionals, and have larger pools of skilled administrators. Provinces with weaker economic bases are more dependent on national transfers, struggle to fill professional positions, and inherit institutional deficits that compound over time. Evaluating a provincial government fairly requires understanding where that province sits on this spectrum and what constraints it faces that are beyond any premier's or MEC's control.

## The Accountability Paradox: Why Provinces Look Up, Not Down

The most consequential structural feature of South Africa's provincial government system is one that most citizens never think about: provinces are accountable upward, to national government, far more than they are accountable downward, to the citizens they serve. This is not because of bad faith or poor governance culture—though both exist. It is because the fiscal architecture makes it so.

When you raise your own revenue—when you tax your own citizens and spend the proceeds on services for those citizens—you create a direct accountability loop. Citizens pay, they receive services, and if the services are poor, they have a direct fiscal complaint: "I am paying for services I am not receiving." This is the accountability dynamic that exists in municipalities, which raise significant own revenue from property rates and service charges. It is, notably, the accountability dynamic that exists in functional democracies at every level of government.

Provinces lack this dynamic almost entirely. Your province does not tax you. The money your province spends was raised by SARS, allocated by National Treasury, and transferred through DORA. If your provincial education department fails to deliver textbooks, you have a service delivery complaint—but you do not have a fiscal complaint against the province, because the province did not take your money. The fiscal complaint runs to SARS and National Treasury, who collected the tax revenue that funded the equitable share that funded the education department that failed to deliver textbooks. The accountability chain is long, indirect, and diffuse.

The entity that does have a direct fiscal relationship with the province is National Treasury. Treasury allocates the money, sets the conditions for conditional grants, monitors spending through in-year reporting requirements, and publishes analyses of provincial expenditure patterns. The AGSA audits provincial departments annually and reports findings to Parliament. The DPME assesses provincial management quality through the Management Performance Assessment Tool (MPAT). These national oversight mechanisms create genuine accountability pressure—provinces do respond to audit findings, Treasury monitoring, and DPME assessments. But the accountability runs upward, to the national institutions that control the money, not downward to the citizens who receive the services.

This upward accountability orientation has practical consequences. Provincial departments invest significant administrative effort in reporting to national government—quarterly performance reports, conditional grant expenditure reports, DPME questionnaires, AGSA audit preparation. This reporting infrastructure exists because the money comes from above and the monitoring comes from above. The equivalent infrastructure for reporting to citizens—accessible performance information, meaningful public participation processes, responsive complaint mechanisms—is typically much weaker, because the fiscal incentive to maintain it is weaker. Citizens cannot reduce a province's funding the way National Treasury can. Citizens cannot qualify a province's audit opinion the way AGSA can. The asymmetry in fiscal power produces an asymmetry in accountability effort.

:::expert
The Public Affairs Research Institute (PARI), in its research programme on state capacity and governance in South Africa, has analysed the structural drivers of accountability failures in provincial government. PARI's research, drawing on case studies of provincial departments across multiple sectors and provinces, identifies a pattern that the institute describes as "upward performance, downward neglect": provincial departments develop sophisticated reporting systems oriented toward national oversight requirements (Treasury in-year monitoring, AGSA audit preparation, DPME performance assessments) while simultaneously neglecting the citizen-facing information and complaint systems that would enable downward accountability. PARI's analysis attributes this pattern to rational institutional behaviour—departments allocate scarce administrative capacity to the accountability relationships that carry the most immediate consequences. A negative AGSA audit finding can trigger national intervention; a citizen complaint about clinic waiting times typically does not. The research concludes that closing the downward accountability gap requires more than better public participation processes—it requires structural changes to the fiscal relationship between provinces and citizens, including consideration of limited provincial taxing powers that would create a direct fiscal accountability link between provincial government and the population it serves.

## When Provinces Fail: Section 100 Interventions

The Constitution provides a mechanism for when a province fails to fulfil its constitutional obligations. Section 100 of the Constitution allows the national executive to intervene in provincial government when a province "cannot or does not fulfil an executive obligation in terms of the Constitution or legislation." The intervention comes in two forms: Section 100(1)(a) allows the national executive to issue a directive to the province, describing the extent of the failure and setting out the steps required to meet the obligation. Section 100(1)(b) allows the national executive to assume the relevant provincial obligation to the extent necessary to maintain essential national standards, meet established minimum standards for the rendering of a service, prevent unreasonable provincial action that is prejudicial to another province or the country as a whole, or maintain economic unity.

The distinction between (a) and (b) matters. A Section 100(1)(a) intervention is a directive—the province is told what to do but retains responsibility for doing it. A Section 100(1)(b) intervention is an assumption of responsibility—national government takes over the function. The NCOP must be notified of any intervention and can review it.

The most comprehensive use of Section 100 occurred in Limpopo in December 2011. The national government placed five provincial departments under Section 100(1)(b) administration: Education, Health, Public Works, Roads and Transport, and the Provincial Treasury. The intervention was triggered by findings of pervasive financial mismanagement, including massive irregular expenditure, collapsed supply chain management, and the failure to deliver textbooks to schools—an episode that became a national scandal when it was revealed that millions of textbooks for the 2012 school year had not been distributed, with some found dumped in a warehouse and others allegedly destroyed. The Limpopo intervention lasted several years and achieved mixed results: some acute financial management problems were stabilised, but the underlying institutional capacity weaknesses persisted.

The North West was placed under a Section 100(1)(b) intervention in 2018, amid a broader governance crisis that included allegations of state capture, the collapse of several provincial departments, and the inability of the then-premier to maintain executive authority. The intervention followed a period in which AGSA had flagged deteriorating audit outcomes across the province's departments and the provincial health system had experienced severe service delivery failures.

The track record of Section 100 interventions raises difficult questions about the mechanism's effectiveness. Interventions address symptoms—financial mismanagement, service delivery collapse—but they do not address the root causes: the politicisation of administrative appointments, the thin skills base in former homeland provinces, the structural fiscal dependence that limits provincial autonomy, and the political dynamics that make accountability difficult. When the intervention ends, the same structural conditions often reassert themselves. The province that was placed under administration for financial mismanagement frequently returns to financial mismanagement within a few years of the intervention's conclusion—because the institutional environment that produced the mismanagement has not fundamentally changed.

## Education and Health: Where 80% of Your Provincial Budget Goes

If you want to understand what your provincial government actually does with its money, you need to understand two sectors: basic education and health. Together, these two functions consume roughly 80% of every provincial budget, according to National Treasury's Provincial Budget and Expenditure Review. Provincial government is, in fiscal terms, primarily a school-and-hospital delivery system.

### Education

Your province's education department is the largest employer of any single provincial department. It hires teachers, manages school infrastructure, provides learner transport in rural areas, and oversees the administration of approximately 23,000 public schools nationally (Department of Basic Education data). The quality of basic education in your province—measured by matric pass rates, but more meaningfully by the quality of learning in earlier grades as assessed by international studies like TIMSS and PIRLS—is the most consequential service your provincial government provides. Education outcomes shape individual life chances, provincial economic productivity, and intergenerational mobility.

Provincial education departments face a structural fiscal challenge. The overwhelming majority of education spending—typically 80–85% of the education budget—goes to personnel costs: teacher salaries and benefits. These salaries are determined by national collective bargaining in the Education Labour Relations Council, not by the province. When the national wage agreement increases teacher salaries by 7% but the equitable share grows by only 5%, the province must find the difference—usually by cutting non-personnel spending on textbooks, maintenance, learner transport, and school nutrition programmes, or by not replacing teachers who leave. The result is a slow erosion of the non-salary inputs that affect education quality, even as the salary bill consumes an ever-larger share of the budget.

### Health

Your province's health department runs the public hospitals and primary healthcare clinics where the majority of South Africans access healthcare. Provincial health spending is the second-largest budget item, typically accounting for 30–35% of total provincial expenditure. The province is responsible for district hospitals, regional hospitals, and tertiary hospitals (in partnership with national government and university medical schools), as well as community health centres and primary healthcare clinics.

Provincial health systems face their own version of the education fiscal squeeze. Personnel costs dominate—but the challenge is compounded by the cost of medical supplies, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment maintenance, and the medico-legal claims crisis. Several provinces face billions of rands in outstanding medico-legal claims—claims from patients who suffered harm due to medical negligence in provincial hospitals. Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal have the largest medico-legal liabilities, with contingent liabilities exceeding their entire annual health budgets. These claims do not directly reduce current spending—they are contingent liabilities, not current expenditure—but they represent a fiscal risk that hangs over provincial health budgets and can trigger cash flow crises when settlements are paid out.

The variation between provinces in health outcomes is stark. The Western Cape and Gauteng have the strongest provincial health systems, with the highest concentration of medical professionals, the best-equipped facilities, and the most functional district health services. The Eastern Cape and Limpopo have the weakest, with chronic vacancies for doctors and specialists, poorly maintained facilities, and persistent medicine stockouts. These differences directly affect your health outcomes: if you live in a province with a strong health system, you are more likely to receive timely, competent care. If you live in a province with a weak health system, you face longer waiting times, higher risks of medical errors, and a greater probability that your local clinic will not have the medication you need.

## Evaluating Your Province: A Fair Framework

Evaluating your provincial government fairly requires understanding both what it controls and what it does not. Here is a practical framework for assessing provincial performance within the constraints the system imposes.

### What Your Province Controls

Your province controls the quality of implementation. Two provinces receiving identical equitable share allocations and facing similar demographic profiles can produce very different outcomes. One can deliver textbooks on time, maintain school infrastructure, staff clinics adequately, and manage its finances cleanly. Another can fail at all of these. The difference is implementation quality—the competence and integrity of the premier, the MECs, the HODs, and the thousands of provincial officials who deliver services daily. When you evaluate your province, implementation quality is what you are evaluating.

Your province also controls the appointment of senior officials. The Premier appoints HODs. The MECs oversee their departments. The choices made at this level—whether to appoint competent professionals or political loyalists, whether to maintain stable leadership or create constant turnover, whether to support administrative authority or undermine it—are provincial choices with provincial consequences.

### What Your Province Does Not Control

Your province does not control how much money it receives. The equitable share formula and conditional grant allocations are determined nationally. If your province needs more health funding because of a growing population or a disease burden, it must argue its case through the intergovernmental fiscal process—it cannot raise taxes to fill the gap.

Your province does not control national wage agreements. When the national government agrees to increase public servant salaries, your province must pay the increase from its existing budget—whether or not the equitable share has grown enough to cover it.

Your province does not control the policy framework. The national curriculum, national health treatment protocols, national housing policy, and national norms and standards for school infrastructure are set in Pretoria. Your province implements them.

### How to Check Your Province's Performance

The Auditor-General of South Africa publishes an annual PFMA audit report covering every national and provincial government department. You can look up your province's departments on the AGSA website (www.agsa.co.za) and see their audit outcomes: clean audit (the best—financial statements are accurate and the department complied with legislation), unqualified with findings (financial statements are accurate but there are compliance or performance reporting findings), qualified (material misstatements in the financial statements), adverse (pervasive misstatements), or disclaimer (the department could not provide sufficient evidence for the auditor to form an opinion—the worst outcome). Track your province's audit outcomes over time. Improvement signals strengthening governance. Deterioration signals growing dysfunction.

National Treasury publishes provincial budget data in its annual Budget Review and in the Provincial Budget and Expenditure Review. You can see how much your province received, how it allocated spending across departments, and whether it under- or overspent its budget. Look for patterns: chronic underspending on capital budgets suggests the province cannot implement infrastructure projects. Overspending on personnel budgets suggests an unsustainable wage bill.

The DPME publishes the Management Performance Assessment Tool (MPAT) results, which assess the quality of management practices in national and provincial departments across four areas: strategic management, governance and accountability, human resource management, and financial management. MPAT scores give you a comparative picture of how your province's management systems measure up.

Your provincial legislature's committee reports—if publicly available on the legislature's website—provide oversight findings that can reveal how the legislature itself assesses departmental performance. The Parliamentary Monitoring Group (www.pmg.org.za) tracks some provincial committee proceedings.

### The Questions That Matter

When you read about your provincial government's performance, ask these questions. First, is the province spending its budget? Underspending—particularly on capital and conditional grants—means services and infrastructure that should have been delivered were not. Second, is the province getting clean audits? The audit outcome is the most reliable single indicator of financial management quality. Third, are health and education outcomes improving? Matric results (available from the Department of Basic Education), facility audit outcomes (from the Office of Health Standards Compliance), and maternal mortality rates (from the provincial health department) are concrete, measurable indicators. Fourth, is there leadership stability? Frequent changes in HOD positions, acting appointments in senior roles, and political instability in the executive signal an administration under stress. Fifth, has the province been subject to Section 100 intervention? If so, what triggered it, what was the outcome, and have the underlying problems been addressed?

No province governs in a vacuum. Your province operates within a fiscal framework it did not design, implements policies it did not write, and employs staff whose salaries it did not negotiate. Holding your provincial government accountable means holding it accountable for what it can control—the quality of implementation, the integrity of appointments, the effectiveness of oversight—while understanding the structural constraints that shape what is possible. The awkward middle child of South African governance deserves neither the free pass it sometimes receives nor the unfair blame it often absorbs. It deserves scrutiny that is informed, specific, and fair.
