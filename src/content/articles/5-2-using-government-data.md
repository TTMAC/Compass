## The Library That Nobody Visits

In *Reading the Auditor-General's Reports*, you learned how to interpret the annual audit that tells you whether government managed its money properly. But the Auditor-General's reports are one source among many. South Africa's government publishes more data about its own performance, spending, and service delivery than almost any other country on the African continent — budgets, surveys, census results, quarterly expenditure figures, performance assessments, school registers, poverty statistics, and municipal financial reports. The data exists. It is public. Much of it is free to download.

Here is the bottom line: the gap between what government publishes and what citizens actually use is not a problem of secrecy. It is a problem of navigation. The data is scattered across dozens of websites, published in formats that range from accessible dashboards to impenetrable spreadsheets, and produced by institutions whose names most citizens have never heard. Nobody has drawn you a map.

This article is that map. It will walk you through the major government data sources — what each one publishes, where to find it, how to read it, and what questions it can help you answer. By the end, you will have a practical vocabulary for turning public data into accountability claims — not as a data scientist, but as an informed citizen who knows where to look.

## National Treasury: Following the Rands and Cents

You were introduced to National Treasury's budget documents in *Following the Money*. Here, we go deeper — not into the policy they contain, but into the data platforms that make them usable.

### The Budget Documents

Every February, National Treasury publishes the full suite of annual budget documentation at [treasury.gov.za](https://www.treasury.gov.za). The key documents are:

- **The Budget Review** — the overview of fiscal policy, revenue projections, and expenditure plans. Start with its executive summary for the big picture.
- **The Estimates of National Expenditure (ENE)** — the most granular document, showing what each national department plans to spend, on what programmes, against what targets, and what it achieved in prior years. Each department gets its own chapter. If you want to know how much the Department of Basic Education allocated to school infrastructure, the ENE tells you.
- **The Division of Revenue Bill** — which becomes the Division of Revenue Act (DORA), showing exactly how much each province and each municipality will receive in equitable share allocations and conditional grants.
- **The Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS)** — published every October, providing a mid-year update on fiscal strategy and revised expenditure estimates.

These documents are published as PDFs — dense, long, and technical. But they contain information that no other source provides at the same level of detail. The ENE alone runs to over 1,000 pages and includes programme-level budgets, historical spending data, and performance indicators for every national department.

### Vulekamali: The Citizen's Budget Portal

If the raw budget documents are a library, Vulekamali is the catalogue. Launched in 2018 as a joint project between National Treasury and the civic technology organisation OpenUp, Vulekamali — the name means "open money" in isiZulu — was designed specifically to make government budget data accessible to citizens who do not have accounting degrees.

At [vulekamali.gov.za](https://vulekamali.gov.za), you can browse national and provincial budget data by department, programme, or economic classification. The platform includes department-by-department budget breakdowns, in-year spending data showing monthly transaction totals, provincial infrastructure project data, and learning resources that explain the budget process in plain language. The data is downloadable in multiple formats, and the platform includes an API for programmatic access — useful for researchers and journalists who want to analyse the data systematically.

Vulekamali does not replace the budget documents. It translates them. If the ENE tells you that the Department of Health allocated R67 billion to district health services, Vulekamali shows you how that figure compares to previous years, what it breaks down into by economic category, and how much was actually spent. For a citizen who wants to understand whether their province is receiving more or less than last year, Vulekamali provides the answer in minutes rather than the hours it would take to extract the same information from the raw budget PDFs.

### Municipal Money: Your Municipality's Financial X-Ray

For municipal-level data, National Treasury operates two complementary platforms. The Municipal Finance Data portal at [municipaldata.treasury.gov.za](https://municipaldata.treasury.gov.za) provides the raw data — income and expenditure (budgeted and actual), cash flow statements, balance sheets, and grant spending data for all 257 municipalities, spanning financial years from 2008/09 to the present. The data is downloadable in Excel, CSV, and machine-readable JSON formats.

The citizen-facing portal, Municipal Money at [municipalmoney.gov.za](https://municipalmoney.gov.za), transforms this raw data into comparative dashboards. You can look up your municipality and see at a glance how it performs on key financial indicators: what percentage of its budget it actually spent, how its spending compares to similar municipalities, whether it is generating enough own revenue to sustain itself, and how much it received in grants versus how much it collected from ratepayers. The platform allows side-by-side comparisons — you can compare your municipality's financial performance against its neighbours, against the provincial average, or against municipalities of similar size and type.

For the citizen who wants to move beyond "my municipality is failing" to "my municipality underspent its infrastructure grant by 40% while the neighbouring municipality spent 95% of the same grant," Municipal Money provides the evidence.

:::takeaway
National Treasury publishes three layers of fiscal data: the raw budget documents (ENE, DORA, Budget Review) at treasury.gov.za, the citizen-accessible Vulekamali portal at vulekamali.gov.za for national and provincial budgets, and the Municipal Money portal at municipalmoney.gov.za for municipal financial performance. Together, these platforms allow any citizen to trace public money from national allocation to municipal spending — and to compare how their government's financial performance stacks up against comparable entities. The data is free, public, and updated annually.
:::

## Statistics South Africa: Measuring the Country

If National Treasury tells you how money is allocated and spent, Statistics South Africa (Stats SA) tells you what the country actually looks like — how many people live where, what they earn, whether they have water and electricity, how many are employed, how much prices have risen, and how poverty is changing over time. Stats SA is the national statistics agency, established under the Statistics Act 6 of 1999, and its data underpins virtually every policy debate in South Africa.

### The Census and Community Survey

The census is the most comprehensive data collection exercise the government undertakes. Census 2022 — the first to be conducted digitally — counted a total population of 62,027,503, up from 51.8 million in 2011. Census data is published at [census.statssa.gov.za](https://census.statssa.gov.za) and provides demographic, social, and economic data at national, provincial, municipal, and ward level.

Between census years, Stats SA conducts a Community Survey — a large-sample household survey that provides intercensal demographic and socioeconomic data. The most recent Community Survey was conducted in 2016. Together, the census and Community Survey provide the baseline population data that the equitable share formulas described in *Following the Money* use to allocate billions of rand across provinces and municipalities. When you read that KwaZulu-Natal receives a larger share of the provincial equitable share than the Western Cape, the reason traces back to the population data that Stats SA collected.

### Household Surveys: The Pulse of the Nation

Stats SA conducts several recurring household surveys that measure living conditions, employment, and service delivery in near-real-time:

- **The Quarterly Labour Force Survey (QLFS)** — conducted every quarter, this is South Africa's official source for employment and unemployment data. It covers individuals aged 15 and older and produces the headline unemployment rate that dominates economic news coverage. The QLFS tells you not just how many people are unemployed, but the composition of unemployment — by age, gender, province, education level, and industry.

- **The General Household Survey (GHS)** — an annual household survey covering all nine provinces, collecting data on access to services (water, electricity, sanitation, refuse removal), education, health, housing conditions, and food security. If you want to know what percentage of households in your province have access to piped water inside their dwelling — as opposed to from a communal tap or a river — the GHS provides that figure.

- **The Living Conditions Survey (LCS)** and **Income and Expenditure Survey (IES)** — these surveys measure household income, expenditure patterns, and consumption. The most recent IES (2022/23) is being used to update Stats SA's poverty lines and to rebase the poverty trends that inform social policy.

### Poverty Data: Who Is Poor, and How Do We Know?

Stats SA publishes national poverty lines using an internationally recognised cost-of-basic-needs methodology. There are three poverty lines: the food poverty line (the amount needed to purchase enough food for adequate nutrition), the lower-bound poverty line (food plus essential non-food items), and the upper-bound poverty line (food plus a broader range of non-food items). The poverty lines are updated annually to account for price changes. Stats SA's *Poverty Trends in South Africa* reports — which track poverty rates over time, disaggregated by province, gender, age, and geographic type — are among the most important publications for understanding whether the country's social policies are achieving their stated goals.

### The Consumer Price Index and GDP

Stats SA's monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) data measures inflation — the rate at which the prices of goods and services are rising. The quarterly Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures measure the total value of economic output. Both are published as statistical releases with accompanying media presentations. For citizens, these figures matter because they are the benchmarks against which government spending should be assessed. If government spending on health grew by 5% but inflation was 6%, the real spending on health has declined — even though the nominal figure increased. Stats SA's inflation data is the tool you need to convert nominal budget figures into real ones.

### Accessing Stats SA Data

All Stats SA publications are available as free PDF downloads at [statssa.gov.za](https://www.statssa.gov.za). For citizens who want to explore the data interactively — creating custom tables, cross-tabulations, and charts — Stats SA offers SuperWEB2, a web-based tool at [superweb.statssa.gov.za](https://superweb.statssa.gov.za/webapi) that allows users to query census and survey datasets directly. Registration is free. The platform includes datasets from the 1996, 2001, and 2011 censuses, the Community Survey, the Income and Expenditure Survey, and several other household surveys. Stats SA also publishes accessible narratives on its Data Stories page and press releases that summarise key findings in plain language.

A word of caution on data quality. Census 2022, while a landmark as the first digital census, had significant quality challenges. The overall under-count rate was 31% — meaning nearly a third of the population was not counted in the initial enumeration and had to be estimated through statistical adjustment. For some population groups, under-count rates exceeded 60%. Stats SA announced in 2024 that it would not release key datasets on mortality, fertility, employment, and household income from Census 2022 due to reporting anomalies. These quality issues do not invalidate Stats SA's broader data ecosystem — the household surveys, poverty data, and economic statistics remain robust — but they are a reminder that government data should be used critically, not uncritically. Always check the methodology notes that accompany any statistical release.

:::expert
Stats SA's data infrastructure reflects a broader challenge common to middle-income countries: the tension between the demand for granular, ward-level data that could inform local planning and accountability, and the institutional capacity and funding required to produce data at that resolution reliably. The census is the only instrument that provides ward-level population data, and it is conducted only every ten years. Between censuses, household surveys like the QLFS and GHS provide robust data at national and provincial level, but their sample sizes are too small to produce reliable estimates for individual municipalities, let alone wards. This means that the data most useful for local accountability — how many households in your specific ward lack water, how unemployment compares between your ward and the next — is available only from the census, and the most recent census had significant quality limitations. Civil society organisations and researchers have attempted to fill this gap through small-area estimation techniques and data integration, but these methods require statistical expertise that most citizens and local officials do not possess. The result is a paradox: the level of government closest to citizens — the municipality — is often the level for which the least reliable data is available.

## The Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation: Watching the Watchers

The Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation (DPME), located in the Presidency, is the institution responsible for assessing whether government is actually delivering on its plans. If National Treasury tracks the money and Stats SA counts the people, DPME asks the question: are the departments and municipalities doing what they said they would do?

### The Government-Wide Monitoring and Evaluation System

DPME operates the Government-Wide Monitoring and Evaluation System (GWM&ES) — an integrated framework of monitoring tools used to evaluate performance across all three spheres. The system encompasses several assessment instruments, each designed to measure a different dimension of government performance.

The **Management Performance Assessment Tool (MPAT)** assesses the quality of management practices in national and provincial government departments. MPAT evaluates strategic management, governance and accountability, human resources management, and financial management — producing scores that allow departments to be compared against each other and tracked over time. Its local government equivalent, the **Local Government Management Improvement Model (LGMIM)**, applies a similar methodology to municipalities.

### Frontline Service Delivery Monitoring

DPME's most citizen-relevant programme is Frontline Service Delivery Monitoring (FSDM), operational since 2011. Rather than relying on departments' self-reported performance, FSDM sends monitors to actual facilities — clinics, schools, police stations, Home Affairs offices — to assess the quality of service as experienced by citizens. The monitors check waiting times, facility conditions, staff attitudes, availability of medicines and resources, and whether the facility meets basic standards.

The FSDM findings are published by DPME and provide a reality check on the performance data that departments publish in their annual reports. A provincial health department may report that 95% of clinics are "operational," but an FSDM visit might reveal that "operational" includes clinics with broken equipment, absent staff, and two-hour waiting times. The gap between self-reported performance and independently verified performance is one of the most important things that DPME's monitoring reveals.

### Citizen-Based Monitoring

DPME has also developed a Citizen-Based Monitoring (CBM) framework — a structured approach to incorporating citizens' direct experience of government services into the monitoring system. CBM is not a complaint mechanism. It is a partnership framework in which citizens are trained to assess specific facilities using standardised tools, and their assessments feed into the same monitoring system that informs national policy decisions. The CBM framework document, available at [dpme.gov.za](https://www.dpme.gov.za), sets out how these partnerships should work.

### Annual Performance Plans

Every national and provincial department publishes an Annual Performance Plan (APP) — a document that sets out the department's targets for the coming financial year, linked to measurable indicators. APPs are tabled in Parliament and the relevant provincial legislature, and they are the benchmark against which the Auditor-General assesses performance information during the annual audit. If a department's APP says it will build 200 houses and it builds 80, the Auditor-General will report on that gap. If the department changes its indicators mid-year to avoid unfavourable comparisons, the Auditor-General will flag that too.

APPs are available on departmental websites and through the Parliamentary Monitoring Group at [pmg.org.za](https://pmg.org.za), which archives the briefings that departments give to parliamentary committees on their plans and performance. For a citizen who wants to hold a specific department accountable for a specific promise, the APP is the document that converts political rhetoric into measurable commitments.

## The Parliamentary Monitoring Group: Parliament's Public Memory

The Parliamentary Monitoring Group (PMG) at [pmg.org.za](https://pmg.org.za) is not a government institution — it is an independent civil society organisation that monitors and documents the proceedings of every parliamentary committee. But it is so essential to government accountability that no article about using government data would be complete without it.

PMG maintains monitors who attend every committee meeting (except the Intelligence Committee, which is closed), record the proceedings, and publish detailed unofficial minutes within three working days. Since 1998, PMG has built the most comprehensive public archive of parliamentary committee activity in South Africa. The archive includes meeting minutes, tabled documents, public submissions, working drafts of bills, departmental briefings, questions to ministers and their written responses, and MP attendance records.

For citizens, PMG answers questions that no other source can. Did the parliamentary health committee actually interrogate the Department of Health on its audit findings? What did the director-general commit to in response? Which MPs were present, and which were absent? Has the department appeared before the committee again to report on progress? PMG documents all of this, creating an accountability trail that connects audit findings to parliamentary action — or parliamentary inaction.

PMG also publishes weekly bill status reports, tracking every piece of legislation through the parliamentary process. If you made a public submission on a bill (using the skills from *Making Public Submissions*), PMG tells you what happened next: whether the committee considered your submission, whether the bill was amended, and when it is scheduled for a vote.

Most PMG content is freely accessible. Some premium features may require a subscription, but the core archive of committee meeting reports, tabled documents, and legislation tracking is available to all.

## Your Right to Ask: The Promotion of Access to Information Act

Everything described so far — Treasury data, Stats SA surveys, AGSA reports, DPME assessments, PMG archives — is information that government publishes proactively. But what about information that government holds but does not publish? For that, you have a constitutional right and a legislative tool.

Section 32 of the Constitution provides that everyone has the right of access to any information held by the State, and to information held by another person that is required for the exercise or protection of any rights. The Promotion of Access to Information Act 2 of 2000 (PAIA) gives legislative effect to this right, establishing the procedure for requesting access to records held by public and private bodies.

### How PAIA Works

The PAIA process is straightforward in design, if not always in practice:

1. **Identify the body** that holds the information you need — the national department, provincial department, municipality, or public entity.
2. **Find the body's Information Officer** — every public body is required to designate an Information Officer and publish a PAIA Manual (available on their website) that contains contact details and describes the types of records held.
3. **Complete Form 2** — the official Request for Access to Record form, available from the Information Regulator's website at [inforegulator.org.za/paia-forms](https://inforegulator.org.za/paia-forms/). If you cannot read or write, you may make a verbal request and the Information Officer must complete the form on your behalf.
4. **Submit the form** to the Information Officer or Deputy Information Officer.
5. **Wait for a response** — the Information Officer must respond within 30 calendar days. If the request involves a large volume of records or records held off-site, the period may be extended by an additional 30 days.
6. **If access is refused**, you can lodge an internal appeal (for public bodies, to the Information Officer's superior) or apply to a court for review.

PAIA covers both public bodies (government departments, municipalities, public entities) and private bodies (companies, NGOs). Request fees and access fees (for searching, preparing, and copying records) may apply, though fees are waived for personal information and in certain other circumstances.

### The Information Regulator

Oversight of PAIA was originally the responsibility of the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC). That function has since been transferred to the Information Regulator — an independent body established under the Protection of Personal Information Act (POPIA) that now has a dual mandate covering both data protection and access to information. The Information Regulator's website at [inforegulator.org.za](https://inforegulator.org.za) provides PAIA forms, guidelines, and information about enforcement actions.

The SAHRC continues to play a monitoring and education role. Its *Guide on How to Use the Promotion of Access to Information Act* — available at [sahrc.org.za](https://www.sahrc.org.za/index.php/understanding-paia) — remains one of the most accessible introductions to the PAIA process for citizens who have never filed a request.

### The Reality of PAIA in Practice

The gap between PAIA's design and its implementation is well documented. Response times frequently exceed the statutory 30-day limit. Information Officers may be difficult to identify or contact. Requests may be refused on grounds that are legally questionable. The cost of challenging a refusal in court is prohibitive for most citizens. Civil society organisations like the South African History Archive (SAHA) have been prolific users of PAIA, filing hundreds of requests and documenting the obstacles they encounter — creating a body of practical knowledge about what works and what does not.

Despite these challenges, PAIA remains an indispensable tool. When government data is not published proactively — when you need the minutes of a municipal tender committee meeting, or the contract between your municipality and a service provider, or the technical assessment that informed a procurement decision — PAIA is the mechanism that converts your constitutional right to information into a formal, enforceable request. It is slow, it is sometimes frustrating, and it occasionally requires persistence bordering on stubbornness. But it exists, and it works — particularly when used by citizens who understand the process and are prepared to follow up.

:::takeaway
PAIA gives every person in South Africa the right to request information held by government or private bodies. The process requires completing Form 2 and submitting it to the relevant Information Officer, who must respond within 30 days. The Information Regulator oversees compliance. In practice, the process is often slow and sometimes obstructed — but it remains the legal tool for accessing government records that are not published proactively. Knowing that PAIA exists, and knowing how to use it, gives you a fallback when the published data is not enough.

## Municipal Data: IDPs, Annual Reports, and the Local Paper Trail

Municipalities produce their own constellation of data — separate from what National Treasury, Stats SA, or AGSA publish about them. Understanding this local paper trail is essential because municipalities are the sphere of government closest to your daily life, delivering water, electricity, sanitation, roads, and refuse removal.

### The Integrated Development Plan

Every municipality is required by Section 25 of the Municipal Systems Act 32 of 2000 to adopt an Integrated Development Plan (IDP) — a five-year strategic plan that sets out the municipality's vision, development priorities, spatial development framework, disaster management plans, financial plans, and performance management system. The IDP is not a wish-list. It is a legally binding strategic document that must be linked to the municipal budget through the Service Delivery and Budget Implementation Plan (SDBIP).

The IDP tells you what your municipality has committed to delivering over its term of office. If the IDP says the municipality will extend water connections to 5,000 additional households by 2028, that is a measurable commitment against which you can hold the municipality accountable. If the IDP prioritises road maintenance but the budget allocates most capital expenditure to a new municipal building, the misalignment between plan and budget is visible.

Chapter 4 of the Municipal Systems Act makes community participation in IDP processes a legal obligation. Municipalities must consult communities during drafting and annual review. The IDP review process — which happens every year — is one of the most underutilised participation opportunities available to citizens. IDPs are typically published on municipal websites as downloadable PDFs, and draft IDPs are made available for public comment before adoption.

### Municipal Annual Reports

The Municipal Systems Act requires municipalities to publish annual reports assessing their performance against the indicators and targets set in the IDP and the performance management system. Annual reports include audited financial statements, service delivery statistics, human resources data, and governance reports. They are tabled before municipal councils and are supposed to be publicly accessible.

The annual report is the mirror of the IDP: the IDP says what the municipality plans to do, and the annual report says what it actually did. Comparing the two — targets in the IDP against outcomes in the annual report — is the most direct form of municipal accountability available to citizens. When that comparison is further enriched by the Auditor-General's audit findings and National Treasury's financial data on Municipal Money, you have a comprehensive picture of whether your municipality is planning well, spending properly, and delivering on its promises.

## The Data Intermediaries: Platforms That Translate the Numbers

Between the raw government data and the citizen who needs it sits a layer of intermediary platforms — built by civil society organisations, universities, and civic technology groups — that translate government data into accessible, visual, and comparative formats. These platforms are often more useful for citizens than the government portals themselves, because they are designed with the citizen's questions in mind rather than with the government's reporting obligations.

### Wazimap: Your Neighbourhood in Numbers

Wazimap at [wazimap.com](https://wazimap.com) — built by OpenUp using census, survey, and elections data — is the leading public-sector data dashboard in South Africa. It provides interactive maps and tables for any area in the country, from national level down to province, municipality, and ward. You can look up your ward and see its demographic profile, access to services, education levels, employment statistics, and housing conditions — all drawn from official Stats SA data but presented in a format that is immediately comprehensible.

Wazimap answers the question that citizens most often ask: "What does my area look like compared to others?" If 40% of households in your ward lack piped water inside their dwelling, Wazimap shows you how that compares to the municipal average, the provincial average, and the national average. The comparison transforms a data point into a diagnostic.

### DataFirst: The Research Gateway

DataFirst at the University of Cape Town ([datafirst.uct.ac.za](https://www.datafirst.uct.ac.za)) is a research data service that provides access to survey and administrative microdata from South Africa and other African countries. Its Open Data Portal hosts over 400 studies, including the Post-Apartheid Labour Market Series (PALMS) — a harmonised dataset spanning 1993 to 2025 that allows researchers to track employment trends across three decades. DataFirst requires registration (free for open-access datasets) and provides training courses and helpdesk support for users who need assistance with data analysis.

DataFirst is more technical than Wazimap or Municipal Money — it is designed for researchers, students, and analysts rather than general citizens. But it is an essential resource for civil society organisations, journalists, and academics who need to conduct rigorous analysis of government data. If Wazimap is the dashboard, DataFirst is the engine room.

### The Open Data South Africa Toolkit

The Open Data South Africa Toolkit at [opendataza.gitbook.io/toolkit](https://opendataza.gitbook.io/toolkit) provides a comprehensive guide to all publicly available government data resources, organised by sector — education, water and climate, health, crime, and more. It catalogues datasets from the Department of Basic Education (including the EMIS Schools Masterlist with information on every school in the country), water services data, and spatial datasets. For citizens who know what question they want to answer but do not know which government portal holds the relevant data, the Open Data SA Toolkit is the index.

:::expert
South Africa's open data landscape illustrates a pattern that the Open Government Partnership's Independent Reporting Mechanism has documented across multiple countries: the data exists, but the bridge between publication and use remains fragile. South Africa is a founding member of the Open Government Partnership (since 2011) and is currently implementing its 5th National Action Plan (2024–2026), which includes specific commitments on fiscal transparency through Vulekamali and the Municipal Money portal, and on developing a citizen-oriented open data framework through the CSIR's Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Yet the IRM's evaluation has found that use of government data remains limited, with low citizen awareness of what data is available. The critical insight from the OGP experience is that publishing data is necessary but not sufficient. Data intermediaries — the Wazimaps, the Municipal Moneys, the PMGs — perform the translation function that makes government data usable. When these intermediaries are well-funded and technically capable, open data produces accountability outcomes. When they are not, the data sits on government servers, technically public but practically invisible. The 2024–2026 Action Plan's emphasis on building citizen data literacy and engaging "data champions" in targeted municipalities reflects a hard-won recognition that supply-side publication must be matched by demand-side capacity.

## When Citizens Use the Data: Accountability in Action

The data sources described in this article are not theoretical. Civil society organisations, journalists, and citizens have used them to achieve concrete accountability outcomes that changed government behaviour, established legal precedents, and improved service delivery. Understanding these examples shows you what is possible when government data meets informed civic action.

### The School Infrastructure Campaign

In 2011, Equal Education — a youth-led movement that uses research alongside mobilisation — launched a campaign for binding minimum norms and standards for school infrastructure. The campaign drew on data from the Department of Basic Education's National Education Infrastructure Management System (NEIMS), which records the condition of every school facility in the country. Equal Education's researchers identified a critical data discrepancy: the Department of Basic Education claimed that only 49 schools lacked access to water, while earlier NEIMS reports indicated that 1,772 schools were without water. The discrepancy demonstrated that the government's own data contradicted its public claims — and that without accurate data, it was impossible to plan or fund the infrastructure upgrades that schools needed.

The campaign succeeded. In November 2013, the Minister of Basic Education signed the Norms and Standards for School Infrastructure into law — binding minimum standards that every school must meet, enforceable through the courts. The norms were a direct product of citizens using government data to expose the gap between official claims and documented reality.

### Following Provincial Health Spending

The Public Service Accountability Monitor (PSAM) at Rhodes University has monitored government spending in the Eastern Cape since 1999. PSAM's methodology is built on government data: it analyses provincial budget allocations using Treasury documents, tracks actual expenditure using quarterly spending data, compares spending against IDP and APP targets, and uses AGSA audit findings to assess financial management quality. PSAM's Budget Analysis and Expenditure Tracking Reports — built entirely from publicly available data — documented a measurable impact: the variance between planned and actual spending in the Eastern Cape Department of Health decreased from R1.946 billion in 2009/10 to R770 million in 2011/12 during the period of intensive monitoring. Sustained scrutiny using government's own data compelled improvements in financial management.

### The Textbook Crisis

In 2012, Section27 — a public interest law centre — used government data and evidence to secure a court order compelling the Limpopo provincial government to deliver outstanding textbooks to schools. The Limpopo textbook crisis was documented through delivery records, procurement data, and departmental performance reports — all government data — that demonstrated the province had failed to deliver textbooks months into the school year. The court order, handed down by the North Gauteng High Court, established that the right to basic education includes the right to textbooks and that failure to deliver them violates the Constitution. The data trail was essential: without documented evidence of non-delivery, the case could not have been brought.

### Tracking Corruption at Scale

Corruption Watch, the South African chapter of Transparency International, operates a platform where citizens can report corruption. Since its launch in 2012, the platform has received over 24,000 reports. Corruption Watch analyses this citizen-generated data alongside government data — audit findings, procurement records, tender databases — to identify corruption trends and hotspots. Its interactive open data tool for rating police stations won four awards at Google's 2018 Impact Challenge. The tool demonstrates that citizen-generated data and government-published data can reinforce each other: government data identifies where the system has failed, and citizen data identifies how those failures are experienced on the ground.

These examples share a common thread: in every case, the accountability outcome depended on citizens or civil society organisations accessing publicly available government data, analysing it with sufficient rigour to identify specific failures, and using the findings to demand — and achieve — concrete changes. The data did not enforce itself. People used it. The data sources described in this article are the raw material. The accountability outcomes depend on citizens who are willing to do the work.

## The Government Data Toolkit: A Practical Starting Point

:::toolkit
**The Government Data Toolkit**

**Step 1: Define your question**

Government data is useful only when you start with a specific question. "Is my municipality performing well?" is too broad. "How much of its Municipal Infrastructure Grant did my municipality spend last year, and what infrastructure was delivered?" is a question that government data can answer. Before you open any portal, define what you want to know, about which entity, for which period.

**Step 2: Match your question to the right source**

- **How much money was allocated?** — National Treasury budget documents at [treasury.gov.za](https://www.treasury.gov.za), or Vulekamali at [vulekamali.gov.za](https://vulekamali.gov.za)
- **How was the money spent?** — Auditor-General reports at [agsa.co.za](https://www.agsa.co.za), National Treasury quarterly expenditure data
- **How does my municipality's spending compare?** — Municipal Money at [municipalmoney.gov.za](https://municipalmoney.gov.za)
- **What is the demographic and service delivery profile of my area?** — Stats SA publications at [statssa.gov.za](https://www.statssa.gov.za), or Wazimap at [wazimap.com](https://wazimap.com)
- **What did the department promise to deliver?** — Annual Performance Plans, available through departmental websites or [pmg.org.za](https://pmg.org.za)
- **What did the department actually deliver?** — DPME performance assessments at [dpme.gov.za](https://www.dpme.gov.za), and AGSA performance audit findings
- **What did my municipality commit to in its strategic plan?** — The Integrated Development Plan, available on the municipal website
- **What happened in Parliament?** — PMG committee records at [pmg.org.za](https://pmg.org.za)
- **I need a record that is not published** — File a PAIA request using Form 2 from [inforegulator.org.za/paia-forms](https://inforegulator.org.za/paia-forms/)

**Step 3: Cross-reference across sources**

No single source tells the full story. The most powerful analysis combines data from multiple sources. Compare the budget allocation (Treasury) against the audit outcome (AGSA) against the service delivery statistics (Stats SA or the municipal annual report). If a department received R2 billion for water infrastructure, spent only R1.2 billion, received a qualified audit opinion on its asset register, and the Stats SA General Household Survey shows that the percentage of households with piped water in the province has declined — you have a documented accountability failure that no single data source could have revealed alone.

**Step 4: Adjust for inflation**

Always check whether the figures you are comparing are in nominal or real terms. A 5% increase in a department's budget means nothing if inflation was 6% — the department's real spending power actually declined. Use Stats SA's CPI data to convert nominal figures to real ones when comparing across years.

**Step 5: Act on what you find**

Data without action is information without purpose. Use your findings to write a public submission (as described in *Making Public Submissions*), attend a municipal IDP review process, contact your ward councillor with specific evidence, file a complaint with the relevant oversight body, or share your analysis with a civil society organisation that works on the relevant issue. The goal is not to become a data analyst. The goal is to become a citizen whose claims are grounded in evidence rather than anecdote.

## Where to Go From Here

You now have a map of South Africa's government data landscape — the fiscal data from National Treasury, the demographic and social data from Stats SA, the performance assessments from DPME, the parliamentary record from PMG, the right to request unpublished records through PAIA, the municipal planning documents that set local targets, and the intermediary platforms that translate all of this into formats citizens can use. You have seen how civil society organisations have used this data to achieve concrete accountability outcomes — from binding school infrastructure standards to court orders on textbook delivery to measurable improvements in provincial financial management.

In *Becoming an Active Citizen*, the final article in this series, we bring everything together. The architecture of the state, the flow of money, the participation rights, the audit findings, and the data sources — all of it converges in a practical framework for sustained civic engagement. Not engagement as a one-off act — attending a single public hearing, reading a single audit report — but engagement as a practice: a recurring, evidence-based, institutionally grounded way of relating to the government that spends your money and delivers your services.

The data is public. The platforms are accessible. The right to information is constitutional. What remains is the decision to use them — and the confidence that comes from knowing where to look. That confidence is what this article was designed to give you.
