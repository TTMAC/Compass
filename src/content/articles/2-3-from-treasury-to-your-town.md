## Where Money Becomes Water, Electricity, and Roads — Or Doesn't

In *Following the Money*, you traced how South Africa collects over R2 trillion in tax revenue through SARS and divides it among three spheres through the Division of Revenue Act. In *The Budget Process*, you walked through the annual cycle that determines those allocations — from the MTBPS in October to budget day in February to parliamentary scrutiny and the audit cycle. You now understand the fiscal pipeline from collection to allocation. This article follows the money to its final destination: your municipality, where national allocations and locally raised revenue are supposed to become the water that flows from your tap, the electricity that powers your home, the refuse collection on your street, and the roads you drive on every day.

Here is the bottom line: the last mile of the fiscal pipeline — from Treasury allocation to municipal service delivery — is where the South African fiscal system most frequently breaks down. The money arrives. The budgets are approved. The plans are filed. And yet, in a growing number of municipalities, the services do not materialise, or they materialise at a quality that no allocation can justify. Understanding why requires looking at the specific mechanics of municipal finance: how money reaches municipalities, how municipalities are supposed to turn it into services, and where the translation from rands to results fails. This is not an abstract fiscal analysis. It is the story of your water, your electricity, your roads, and your rates — and it explains more about your daily quality of life than any other article in this series.

## Three Revenue Streams: How Your Municipality Gets Its Money

Every municipality in South Africa funds its operations from three sources: national government transfers (the equitable share and conditional grants), own revenue (the money the municipality raises directly from ratepayers and service users), and, in some cases, borrowing for capital projects. The balance between these three sources determines a municipality's fiscal character — and understanding that balance tells you more about your municipality's strengths and vulnerabilities than almost any other single data point.

In a metropolitan municipality like the City of Cape Town or the City of Johannesburg, own revenue typically accounts for 70–80% of total income. National transfers supplement this with equitable share funding for free basic services to poor households and conditional grants for specific infrastructure projects. The municipality is, in fiscal terms, a semi-autonomous entity — it raises most of its own money and makes most of its own spending decisions.

In a small rural municipality in the Eastern Cape or Limpopo, the picture is inverted. Own revenue may account for only 10–20% of total income, with national transfers — primarily the equitable share — constituting the overwhelming majority. The municipality is, in fiscal terms, a transfer-dependent entity — it spends money raised and allocated by another sphere of government.

These are not just different revenue profiles. They create fundamentally different accountability dynamics, different service delivery capabilities, and different failure modes. A metropolitan municipality that mismanages its finances faces a direct revenue consequence — ratepayers and businesses relocate, the revenue base erodes, and the municipality's fiscal position deteriorates. A transfer-dependent municipality that mismanages its finances faces a weaker consequence — the equitable share arrives regardless of performance, and the political accountability for poor services is diffused across spheres. Understanding your municipality's position on this spectrum is the first step in following the money from Treasury to your town.

## The Municipal Equitable Share: Money for Free Basic Services

The local government equitable share is the unconditional allocation from national government to municipalities, transferred monthly through a schedule published in DORA. In the 2024/25 financial year, the total local government equitable share was approximately R98 billion, distributed among all 257 municipalities according to a formula designed to fund the provision of free basic services to poor households.

The formula has a specific logic. Its core component — the "basic services component" — calculates the cost of providing four free basic services to each poor household in the municipality: 6 kilolitres of water per month, 50 kilowatt-hours of electricity per month, basic sanitation, and basic refuse removal. The formula estimates the number of poor households in each municipality (using Census and Community Survey data), multiplies by the estimated cost of providing each basic service, and allocates accordingly. A municipality with 50,000 poor households receives a larger basic services allocation than one with 10,000 — because it has more households to serve.

The formula also includes an "institutional component" that provides a base allocation to every municipality to fund basic administrative capacity — a recognition that even a small municipality needs a minimum level of administrative infrastructure (a municipal manager, a finance office, council chambers) to function. There is also a "revenue adjustment" that reduces the allocation for municipalities with significant own-revenue capacity — the logic being that a wealthy metro that can fund its own services needs less equitable share support than a poor rural municipality that cannot.

The equitable share is unconditional, meaning the municipality decides how to spend it within its constitutional mandate. National Treasury cannot dictate that a specific percentage must go to water versus refuse versus administration. In theory, the formula directs money toward free basic services for the poor. In practice, many municipalities use their equitable share to fund salaries, administrative costs, and other operational expenses that have nothing to do with free basic services — and National Treasury, despite monitoring this pattern in its annual local government budget analyses, has limited tools to prevent it.

:::takeaway
The municipal equitable share is designed to fund free basic water, electricity, sanitation, and refuse removal for poor households. But because it is unconditional, municipalities can — and many do — use it for administrative costs, salaries, and other operational expenses. The result is that the money allocated specifically to provide free basic services to your poorest neighbours may never reach them. When your municipality tells you it cannot afford to provide free basic water, the first question is what it did with its equitable share allocation — money that was calculated specifically for that purpose.
:::

## Conditional Grants: Ring-Fenced Money for Specific Municipal Projects

In addition to the equitable share, municipalities receive conditional grants — transfers from national government that are earmarked for specific purposes and come with spending conditions, reporting requirements, and timelines. These grants are the primary mechanism through which national government funds municipal infrastructure development, and their effectiveness determines whether your municipality builds new water pipes, upgrades sewer systems, improves roads, and expands electricity networks.

### The Municipal Infrastructure Grant

The Municipal Infrastructure Grant (MIG) is the largest conditional grant to non-metropolitan municipalities. In the 2024/25 financial year, the MIG allocation totalled approximately R17.4 billion, distributed across district and local municipalities for basic infrastructure — water supply, sanitation, roads, community lighting, and solid waste. The MIG is the fiscal lifeline for infrastructure in municipalities that lack the own-revenue base to fund capital projects themselves.

The MIG's spending rules require municipalities to register projects with the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (COGTA), develop business plans, follow supply chain management procedures, and report on progress. These requirements are designed to ensure that the money is spent on actual infrastructure — but they also impose an administrative burden that many under-capacitated municipalities struggle to meet. The MIG is one of the most chronically underspent conditional grants in the local government system. Money is allocated, projects are registered, but procurement delays, contractor disputes, land availability problems, and sheer administrative incapacity prevent the money from being spent within the financial year.

When MIG funds are not spent, they can be rolled over to the next financial year (with Treasury approval) or, in severe cases, reallocated to other municipalities that can demonstrate spending capacity. The reallocation mechanism is controversial: it effectively punishes the poorest and weakest municipalities — those with the greatest infrastructure needs — for lacking the administrative capacity to spend the money allocated to address those needs. The municipalities that can spend fastest are not necessarily the municipalities that need the most.

### The Urban Settlements Development Grant

Metropolitan municipalities receive the Urban Settlements Development Grant (USDG) instead of the MIG. The USDG, allocated at approximately R14.5 billion in 2024/25, funds bulk infrastructure to support human settlements in metropolitan areas — the water mains, sewer trunks, roads, and electrical networks that make housing development possible. The USDG gives metros more flexibility than the MIG gives non-metro municipalities — reflecting the metros' greater administrative capacity and their more complex infrastructure challenges.

### Other Conditional Grants

Several other conditional grants target specific municipal functions. The Integrated National Electrification Programme (INEP) grant funds electricity connections in areas without supply. The Regional Bulk Infrastructure Grant funds water and sanitation infrastructure that serves multiple municipalities. The Municipal Disaster Recovery Grant provides emergency funding after natural disasters. The Public Transport Network Grant funds bus rapid transit and other public transport infrastructure in selected cities. Each grant has its own allocation formula, spending conditions, and administering national department — creating a complex web of funding streams that municipal finance officials must navigate simultaneously.

:::expert
The National Treasury's annual *Local Government Budget and Expenditure Review*, published alongside the Division of Revenue documentation, provides the most detailed available analysis of how conditional grants to municipalities are actually spent. Treasury's analysis consistently identifies a pattern that it describes as the "spending-capacity paradox": municipalities with the greatest infrastructure backlogs — those serving the poorest communities with the most urgent needs for water, sanitation, and roads — are systematically the municipalities with the lowest conditional grant spending rates. Treasury's data shows that non-metropolitan municipalities collectively spend between 70% and 85% of their MIG allocations in a typical financial year, with the lowest-capacity municipalities spending as little as 40–50%. The infrastructure that does not get built in underspending municipalities does not simply get deferred — the backlogs compound. A water pipe that was needed this year and not built will still be needed next year, alongside the new infrastructure demands created by population growth, urbanisation, and the deterioration of existing systems. Treasury's review notes that the cumulative effect of chronic MIG underspending in the weakest municipalities is a growing infrastructure deficit that outpaces the grant's ability to close it — even if spending rates improved. The gap between infrastructure need and infrastructure delivery is structural, not merely administrative, and the conditional grant system as currently designed cannot close it without complementary investments in municipal institutional capacity.

## The Municipal Business Model: How Own Revenue Works

For municipalities with significant own-revenue capacity — principally the eight metros and a tier of secondary cities — the conditional grants and equitable share are supplements to a self-sustaining business model. Understanding that business model is essential to understanding how your rates, electricity bill, and water charges translate into municipal services.

### Property Rates

Property rates are a tax on the value of land and buildings within the municipality, levied under the Municipal Property Rates Act. The municipality conducts a valuation roll — a register of all properties in its jurisdiction with their assessed values — and applies a rate (expressed as cents per rand of property value) to calculate each property owner's annual rates bill. Rates are the most stable and predictable source of municipal own revenue. They do not fluctuate with consumption (unlike electricity and water charges) and they apply to all property owners regardless of whether they use municipal services.

Rates revenue funds general municipal services — the services that benefit the community as a whole rather than individual consumers: roads, stormwater drainage, parks, public safety, planning, and municipal administration. In a typical metro, property rates contribute 20–25% of total own revenue.

### The Electricity Surcharge: The Hidden Engine of Municipal Finance

If property rates are the foundation of municipal finance, the electricity surcharge is the engine. Most municipalities purchase bulk electricity from Eskom at a regulated wholesale price and sell it to households and businesses at a retail price that includes a markup — the surcharge. This surcharge is not a fee for electricity distribution costs alone. It is a deliberate revenue-generating mechanism that produces a surplus which the municipality uses to cross-subsidise other services.

The electricity surcharge typically generates 25–35% of a metro's total own revenue, making it the single largest revenue source. It funds services that have no direct revenue stream — local roads that generate no toll income, stormwater drainage that cannot be individually billed, parks and public spaces that are free to use, and a portion of municipal administration. Without the electricity surcharge, the municipal business model collapses — a municipality would either need to dramatically increase property rates or dramatically reduce services.

This cross-subsidisation model has a critical vulnerability: it depends on electricity consumption. When load shedding reduces consumption, when businesses install solar panels and reduce their grid purchases, when households switch to gas cooking and prepaid electricity to manage costs, the municipality's electricity revenue declines — and with it, the surplus that funds other services. The growth of rooftop solar in wealthier suburbs, while beneficial for energy security and emissions reduction, directly undermines the revenue model of every municipality that depends on the electricity surcharge. National Treasury's municipal finance analyses have flagged this trend as a medium-term fiscal risk for metropolitan municipalities — a risk that is already materialising in cities like Cape Town and Johannesburg, where electricity sales volumes have stagnated or declined even as the city's population grows.

### Water and Sanitation Charges

Municipal water charges work on a similar principle to electricity: the municipality purchases bulk water from a water board (such as Rand Water in Gauteng or Umgeni Water in KwaZulu-Natal) or treats raw water at its own treatment works, and sells it to consumers at a tariff that covers the cost of bulk supply, treatment, distribution, and — in theory — a contribution to the replacement of ageing infrastructure. Sanitation charges (for sewerage treatment and disposal) are typically levied as a percentage of the water bill or as a flat charge.

Water revenue is the second-largest trading service revenue stream for most municipalities, contributing 15–20% of own revenue in a typical metro. But water revenue is under pressure from the same factors affecting electricity: rising bulk costs (water board tariffs increase annually), ageing distribution networks that lose water to leaks (non-revenue water losses average 35–40% nationally, and exceed 60% in some municipalities, according to the Department of Water and Sanitation's data), and declining payment rates in areas where service quality has deteriorated.

### Refuse Removal Charges

Refuse removal charges are levied on all properties receiving municipal waste collection. The charges are typically modest compared to electricity and water, contributing 3–5% of own revenue. But refuse collection is one of the most visible municipal services — its failure is immediately apparent in uncollected waste on streets — and the revenue it generates is essential to maintaining collection vehicles, staffing collection routes, and operating landfill sites.

## The Revenue Collection Crisis

The municipal business model described above works only if residents and businesses pay their bills. In a growing number of municipalities, they do not — and the reasons extend far beyond simple unwillingness.

The culture of non-payment has deep historical roots. During the apartheid era, boycotts of municipal service charges in Black townships were a deliberate political strategy. After 1994, the expectation that the new government would provide free services — combined with the reality that many households genuinely cannot afford to pay — created a persistent payment challenge. The government's response was the free basic services policy, providing minimum quantities of water and electricity free to qualifying poor households. But the policy was meant to coexist with payment by those who can afford it — and in many municipalities, the payment culture has not been established or has eroded over time.

The problem is compounded by billing failures. Many municipalities — particularly outside the metros — have broken billing systems. Meters are not read for months at a time. Estimated bills bear no relation to actual consumption. Accounts reflect charges for services not received. When a household receives a water bill for R3,000 for a month in which the taps were dry, the response is predictable: they stop paying. And once a household stops paying, the accumulated arrears grow to a level that makes resumption of payment psychologically and financially impossible.

The aggregate numbers are staggering. Total consumer debt owed to municipalities exceeded R300 billion by 2024, according to National Treasury data. Much of this debt is technically irrecoverable — it includes debt from deceased account holders, demolished properties, and households that have moved. But even the portion that is theoretically recoverable represents a revenue loss that directly translates into reduced services.

The revenue collection crisis creates a vicious cycle. Reduced revenue leads to reduced service quality. Reduced service quality reduces residents' willingness to pay. Reduced willingness to pay further reduces revenue. The cycle is most advanced in small towns and secondary cities where the economic base is shrinking, the municipal administration is weak, and the payment culture has collapsed. For these municipalities, the equitable share — which was designed to supplement own revenue, not replace it — becomes the primary funding source, and the services it can sustain are minimal.

:::expert
The South African Local Government Association (SALGA), in its submissions to the National Council of Provinces and to parliamentary committees on local government finance, has documented the compounding nature of the municipal revenue collection crisis. SALGA's analysis distinguishes between three categories of non-payment: inability to pay (households below the poverty line that genuinely cannot afford municipal charges), unwillingness to pay (households that can afford charges but refuse due to dissatisfaction with service quality or a belief that services should be free), and system failure (households that would pay but cannot because the municipality's billing system has broken down — meters are not read, bills are inaccurate, payment channels are inaccessible). SALGA's research, drawing on surveys across municipalities of varying sizes and fiscal profiles, estimates that system failure accounts for a significant and growing proportion of non-payment — perhaps as much as a third in municipalities with degraded administrative capacity. This finding has critical policy implications: a portion of the revenue collection crisis is not a demand-side problem (residents refusing to pay) but a supply-side problem (municipalities unable to bill accurately and collect efficiently). SALGA has recommended that national and provincial government invest in municipal billing and revenue management systems as a prerequisite for fiscal recovery, arguing that no amount of demand-side intervention — awareness campaigns, credit control, service disconnections — will recover revenue that was never accurately billed in the first place.

## The Eskom Municipal Debt Crisis: A Threat to the Entire System

No discussion of municipal finance is complete without confronting the Eskom municipal debt crisis, because it illustrates how a single point of failure in the fiscal pipeline can cascade through the entire system.

Municipalities purchase bulk electricity from Eskom and resell it to consumers. The municipality collects payment from consumers, retains the surcharge, and remits the cost of bulk supply to Eskom. When the municipality fails to collect from consumers — or collects but diverts the revenue to other purposes — it falls behind on its payments to Eskom. The debt accumulates.

By 2024, total municipal debt to Eskom exceeded R78 billion and was growing by several billion rand per quarter, according to Eskom's published financial data. The debt is concentrated in a relatively small number of municipalities — many of them in Mpumalanga, the Free State, and the North West — but the systemic risk is enormous. Eskom, itself in financial distress, cannot absorb the losses indefinitely. When Eskom threatens to cut supply to a municipality that has not paid, the consequences fall on residents and businesses who may have paid their own electricity bills on time — their money was collected by the municipality and not passed on to Eskom.

The Eskom debt crisis reveals a structural flaw in the municipal electricity distribution model. The municipality acts as an intermediary — buying from Eskom, selling to consumers — but there is no mechanism to ensure that the money collected from consumers is ring-fenced for Eskom payments. A municipality that faces a cash flow crisis — because it cannot collect rates, because it has overspent on salaries, because its financial management has broken down — will use whatever cash is available to pay the most pressing bills. Eskom payments are large quarterly obligations that can be deferred. Salary payments are monthly obligations that cannot. The result is predictable: salaries get paid, Eskom does not, and the debt grows.

The national government has attempted several interventions — Eskom debt relief programmes, municipality-specific financial recovery plans, direct national transfers to settle municipal arrears — but the underlying problem persists because it is structural: the intermediary model creates a cash flow risk that weak municipal financial management cannot mitigate. Until the model is reformed — through mechanisms like direct Eskom billing of large consumers, ring-fenced electricity revenue accounts, or the transfer of electricity distribution to a separate entity — the municipal Eskom debt will continue to grow and threaten the financial viability of the municipalities that owe it.

## Two Budgets in One: Operating and Capital

When your municipality tables its annual budget, it contains two fundamentally different components: the operating budget and the capital budget. Understanding the distinction is essential to following the money because the two budgets fund different things, come from different sources, and have different failure modes.

The operating budget funds the municipality's day-to-day running costs: salaries, bulk purchases (electricity from Eskom, water from the water board), vehicle fuel, repairs and maintenance, contracted services, and administrative overheads. Operating revenue comes from own revenue (rates, service charges, fees) and the equitable share. The operating budget is where your monthly rates and service charges go — it keeps the lights on, the water flowing, the refuse trucks running, and the municipal officials at their desks.

The capital budget funds long-term infrastructure investment: new water pipes, new sewer systems, new roads, new electricity networks, new community facilities, and the rehabilitation of existing infrastructure that has reached the end of its useful life. Capital funding comes primarily from conditional grants (the MIG for non-metros, the USDG for metros), borrowing (for metros with strong balance sheets), and internally generated funds (operating surpluses that the municipality sets aside for capital investment).

The distinction matters because the two budgets compete for attention and resources. A municipality under financial pressure — facing a cash flow crisis, salary demands, or Eskom arrears — will prioritise the operating budget over the capital budget. Salaries must be paid this month. A new water pipe can wait until next year. Conditional grant spending can be deferred. The consequence is deferred infrastructure investment — the slow, invisible degradation of the physical systems that deliver your services.

The infrastructure maintenance deficit is the most consequential long-term consequence of this dynamic. The South African Institution of Civil Engineering (SAICE) has published infrastructure report cards grading municipal infrastructure on a scale from A (world-class) to E (unfit for purpose). Water infrastructure nationally has been graded D+ ("at risk of failure"). Sanitation has been graded D-. Roads have been graded D. These grades reflect decades of deferred maintenance — municipalities spending on operations while allowing the physical infrastructure to deteriorate. The cost of catching up grows every year that maintenance is deferred, creating a fiscal trap: the municipality cannot afford to maintain its infrastructure now, and the cost of repairing it later will be even higher.

:::takeaway
Municipal budgets have two components: the operating budget (day-to-day costs funded by own revenue and the equitable share) and the capital budget (infrastructure investment funded by conditional grants and borrowing). When municipalities face financial pressure, they sacrifice the capital budget to protect the operating budget — paying salaries while deferring infrastructure maintenance. The result is the slow collapse of the physical systems that deliver your water, electricity, and sanitation. By the time a pipe bursts or a sewer overflows, the failure has been building for years — and the cause is a fiscal choice made in a budget meeting, not a sudden engineering failure.

## District Versus Local: The Two-Tier Funding Puzzle

Outside the metropolitan areas, South Africa's municipal system adds a layer of complexity that directly affects how money reaches your services: the two-tier system of district and local municipalities.

South Africa has 44 district municipalities, each containing between three and six local municipalities. District and local municipalities share functions and funding in a way that is defined by law but often confusing in practice. Some functions — like water supply and sanitation — may be performed by the district municipality on behalf of the local municipalities within its area. Other functions — like refuse removal and local roads — are typically performed by the local municipality. The division varies from district to district depending on formal "powers and functions" allocations and historical practice.

The fiscal implications are significant. When a district municipality is the "water services authority" for its area (meaning it is responsible for providing water and sanitation services), the national transfers for water — both the equitable share and the relevant conditional grants — flow to the district, not to the local municipality. The district then provides the service to residents within the local municipality's area. But the residents may interact with the local municipality for other services and may not understand that their water is a district function. When the water fails, they blame the local municipality — which may have no role, no budget, and no staff for water services.

This two-tier arrangement creates accountability confusion that is not the citizen's fault. It is a structural feature of the system that even municipal officials sometimes struggle to navigate. The "powers and functions" review — a process through which the division of functions between districts and locals can be adjusted — has been ongoing for years without definitive resolution. In some areas, the assignment of functions has shifted multiple times, creating uncertainty about which municipality is responsible, which is receiving the funding, and which should be held accountable.

For you, the practical implication is straightforward: before you direct a complaint about a municipal service, check whether the function is performed by your local municipality or your district municipality. Your municipality's website, its Integrated Development Plan (IDP), or a call to the municipal offices will tell you. If water and sanitation are district functions in your area, your complaint about water quality should go to the district municipality — not the local municipality whose offices may be closer and more familiar.

## The Water Boards: An Invisible Step in the Pipeline

Between National Treasury and your tap, there is an intermediary that most citizens are unaware of: the water board. South Africa has nine water boards (previously twelve, following mergers) — entities like Rand Water, Umgeni Water, Amatola Water, Sedibeng Water, and Lepelle Northern Water — that buy raw water from the Department of Water and Sanitation, treat it to drinking water standards, and sell bulk treated water to municipalities.

Water boards are national government entities, established under the Water Services Act, reporting to the Minister of Water and Sanitation. They operate the large-scale treatment works and bulk pipeline networks that municipalities cannot afford to build or maintain on their own. Rand Water alone supplies bulk water to municipalities across Gauteng and parts of surrounding provinces, serving an estimated 19 million people.

The water board charges the municipality a bulk tariff for treated water delivered to the municipality's reservoirs. The municipality then distributes the water through its own reticulation network — the local pipes — to your home. The municipality sets the retail tariff that you pay, which must cover the bulk water cost, the distribution cost, and ideally a contribution to infrastructure maintenance and expansion.

The water board model works when both parties — the water board and the municipality — are functional. But when the municipality fails to maintain its reticulation network, the water board's product is wasted. Rand Water can deliver high-quality treated water to a municipal reservoir, but if the municipality's pipes lose 50% of that water to leaks before it reaches your tap, the fiscal pipeline has failed at the very last step. The bulk water has been paid for — by the municipality, using revenue from your water charges and the equitable share — but half of it has literally leaked into the ground.

This is why water losses — technically called "non-revenue water" — are such a critical indicator of municipal performance. The Department of Water and Sanitation's data shows national average non-revenue water losses of approximately 41%, meaning that for every 100 litres of treated water entering municipal distribution networks, only 59 litres are billed to consumers. In some municipalities, losses exceed 60%. The fiscal cost is enormous: municipalities are paying water boards for water that never reaches a paying customer, while simultaneously failing to collect revenue from the water that does.

## When the Money Arrives But the Services Do Not

The most frustrating scenario for any citizen who follows the money is discovering that their municipality received adequate funding but failed to deliver adequate services. This is not hypothetical. It is the norm in a significant number of South Africa's 257 municipalities.

Consider a municipality that receives R200 million in equitable share, R80 million in conditional grants, and generates R150 million in own revenue — a total budget of R430 million. The budget is approved by council. The IDP identifies priorities. The SDBIP sets quarterly targets. On paper, the municipality has the money to deliver water, maintain roads, collect refuse, and keep the administration running.

Twelve months later, the Auditor-General's report reveals the following: the municipality spent 95% of its operating budget (good) but only 55% of its capital budget (bad — R44 million in infrastructure projects did not happen). Irregular expenditure of R60 million was identified — procurement rules were not followed for several large contracts. The municipality's consumer debtors (money owed by ratepayers) grew by R40 million — revenue collection deteriorated. And the municipality ended the year with a cash deficit, meaning it has less cash on hand than its short-term obligations require.

Meanwhile, on your street: the water supply was interrupted 15 times during the year. The pothole reported in March is still there in December. Refuse collection went from weekly to fortnightly in the third quarter because the municipality could not afford to fuel its collection vehicles. The community hall that was funded by the MIG two years ago has a leaking roof that nobody is maintaining.

The money was there. The services were not. The gap between fiscal allocation and service delivery — the gap that is the central theme of this entire series — is widest at the municipal level, because this is where fiscal resources must be converted into physical infrastructure, operational logistics, and frontline staff, in 257 different institutional environments with wildly varying levels of capacity, governance, and political will.

:::expert
The Auditor-General of South Africa, in the annual MFMA Consolidated General Report, has developed a "service delivery" analysis that tracks the relationship between municipal spending and service delivery outcomes. AGSA's analysis of infrastructure project delivery across municipalities shows a persistent gap between budget allocation and project completion: municipalities collectively report spending on infrastructure in their financial statements, but physical verification by AGSA's auditors frequently reveals that the infrastructure is not built to specification, is not complete despite being reported as complete, or does not exist at all. In the 2022/23 MFMA report, AGSA identified "infrastructure delivery" as one of the three most significant areas of concern in local government — alongside financial health and governance. AGSA's root cause analysis attributes the gap to a combination of factors: inadequate project management capacity, poor contract management, insufficient technical oversight during construction, and the absence of consequence management when contractors deliver substandard work. The implication is that following the money to the point of expenditure is necessary but not sufficient — a municipality can spend its entire conditional grant allocation and still fail to deliver the infrastructure the grant was meant to fund, because spending and delivery are not the same thing. The money was spent, but the road, the pipe, or the building does not meet the standard that the money should have bought.

## The Municipal Financial Health Indicators You Should Know

Following the money at the municipal level requires a different set of indicators than following it at the national or provincial level. National and provincial finances are assessed primarily through AGSA's audit outcomes and Treasury's expenditure data. Municipal finances require additional indicators because municipalities are revenue-generating entities with balance sheets, cash flows, and trading operations — more like businesses than like government departments.

The most important indicators are these. The current ratio measures whether the municipality has enough short-term assets (cash, receivables) to cover its short-term obligations (creditors, salaries due, Eskom payments). A ratio below 1.0 means the municipality cannot pay its immediate bills — it is technically insolvent. National Treasury's data shows a growing number of municipalities with current ratios below 1.0, indicating spreading insolvency across the local government system.

The debt coverage ratio measures whether the municipality generates enough operating surplus to service its debt — relevant for municipalities that have borrowed for capital projects. The collection rate measures what percentage of billed revenue the municipality actually collects. A collection rate above 95% is healthy. Below 80% is a warning sign. Below 60% indicates a municipality heading for fiscal collapse. The capital expenditure to total expenditure ratio indicates whether the municipality is investing in infrastructure or consuming all its resources on operations. A ratio below 10% suggests chronic underinvestment.

These indicators are published annually by National Treasury in its *Local Government Budget and Expenditure Review* and by AGSA in the MFMA Consolidated General Report. They are also available on the municipal finance data portal at municipaldata.treasury.gov.za. You do not need an accounting degree to read them — you need only to understand what each one measures and what a healthy versus distressed reading looks like.

## Your Municipal Money Toolkit

:::toolkit
**The Municipal Money Toolkit**

**Step 1: Identify your municipality and its type.** Are you in a metropolitan municipality (Category A), a local municipality (Category B), or served by a district municipality (Category C) for certain functions? This determines your revenue profile and which entity is responsible for which services. Check at [municipaldata.treasury.gov.za](https://municipaldata.treasury.gov.za) or your municipality's website.

**Step 2: Find your municipality's budget.** Municipal budgets are public documents. Your municipality is legally required to publish its annual budget, its IDP, and its SDBIP. Start with the budget summary, which shows total revenue (broken down by source: equitable share, conditional grants, property rates, electricity, water, other) and total expenditure (broken down by function: water, electricity, roads, refuse, administration). Find these on your municipal website or at [municipaldata.treasury.gov.za](https://municipaldata.treasury.gov.za).

**Step 3: Check the equitable share allocation.** Look up your municipality in the Division of Revenue Bill annexures at [treasury.gov.za](https://www.treasury.gov.za). How much equitable share does your municipality receive? How does this compare to previous years? Is it growing with inflation or declining in real terms?

**Step 4: Check conditional grant spending.** If your municipality receives the MIG, the USDG, or other conditional grants, check whether it is spending them. National Treasury's quarterly expenditure data and AGSA's annual reports show spending rates for each conditional grant by municipality. A municipality that consistently underspends its MIG allocation is a municipality where needed infrastructure is not being built — despite the money being available.

**Step 5: Read the Auditor-General's report.** AGSA's annual MFMA report at [agsa.co.za](https://www.agsa.co.za) provides the audit outcome for your municipality and details any irregular expenditure, financial management weaknesses, and service delivery concerns. The audit outcome is your most authoritative measure of municipal financial management quality.

**Step 6: Check the financial health indicators.** At [municipaldata.treasury.gov.za](https://municipaldata.treasury.gov.za), look at your municipality's current ratio, collection rate, and spending on repairs and maintenance as a percentage of total expenditure. A current ratio below 1.0, a collection rate below 80%, or repairs-and-maintenance spending below 8% of operating expenditure are warning signs of a municipality in fiscal distress.

**Step 7: Compare spending to services.** The most powerful accountability question is: my municipality spent R[X] million last year — what did I get for it? Compare the budget to the annual report (what was achieved against targets) and to the AGSA report (whether the spending was regular and the performance claims credible). If the budget shows R50 million for road maintenance and your street has potholes that are six months old, the question is where the R50 million went.

**Step 8: Engage the municipal budget process.** Attend IDP and budget public participation meetings (April to June). Submit written comments on the draft budget. Ask specific questions: what is the municipality's plan for reducing non-revenue water losses? Why was the MIG underspent last year? What is the municipality doing about its Eskom arrears? Municipal officials are required to respond to public submissions. Use this to create a documented record of commitments that you can follow up on.

## Where to Go From Here

You have now followed the money from its source to its destination — from SARS through the National Revenue Fund, through DORA, through the equitable share and conditional grants, through the municipal budget, and into the services you use every day. You understand the three revenue streams that fund your municipality, the business model that turns property rates and electricity surcharges into roads and refuse collection, the revenue collection crisis that is undermining that model, the Eskom debt that threatens to collapse it, and the infrastructure maintenance deficit that is slowly degrading the physical systems you depend on.

This completes Part 2 of the Compass series. You now have a comprehensive understanding of how South Africa's public finances work — from collection to allocation to the budget process to municipal delivery. In Part 3, we turn from money to oversight: *Parliament and National Oversight* examines how the legislature is supposed to hold the executive accountable for how it spends your money, completing the accountability loop that makes the fiscal system meaningful.

The money is public. The documents are public. The data is public. The only thing missing is citizens who follow it.
