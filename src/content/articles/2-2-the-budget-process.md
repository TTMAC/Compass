## The Most Important Calendar You Have Never Seen

Every year, between April and March, South Africa's national government makes the fiscal decisions that determine whether your child's school gets a new classroom, whether your clinic gets chronic medication, whether your municipality gets infrastructure funding, and whether your social grant keeps pace with inflation. These decisions follow a precise calendar — a sequence of planning phases, policy statements, parliamentary debates, and approval votes that repeats every twelve months with clockwork regularity. The calendar is public. The documents are published online. The committee hearings are open. And yet almost no citizen follows it, because nobody has ever explained when the decisions happen, who makes them, and where you can show up to influence the outcome.

Here is the bottom line: the national budget is not an event. It is not the budget speech on a Wednesday afternoon in February when the Minister of Finance holds up a briefcase and the media publishes headline tax numbers. The budget is a twelve-month process with at least seven distinct phases, each involving specific institutions, specific documents, and specific opportunities for public input. If you only pay attention to budget day, you are watching the final scene of a play that started ten months earlier — and the decisions that actually shaped the outcome were made long before the minister stood up in Parliament. This article walks you through the full cycle, phase by phase, so you can identify the moments when the fiscal choices that affect your life are still open to influence.

## The Medium-Term Expenditure Framework: Why the Budget Is Always Three Years Long

Before walking through the annual cycle, you need to understand a structural feature of South Africa's budgeting system that most citizens are unaware of: the budget is not a one-year plan. It is a three-year rolling plan called the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF).

Every February, when the Minister of Finance tables the budget, the documents do not just show what government plans to spend in the coming financial year. They show what government plans to spend over the next three financial years — the "budget year" and two "outer years." The MTEF means that when the 2026/27 budget is tabled in February 2026, it includes detailed allocations for 2026/27 (the budget year), indicative allocations for 2027/28, and preliminary allocations for 2028/29. When the 2027/28 budget is tabled the following year, the process rolls forward: what was the first outer year becomes the new budget year, with revised allocations reflecting updated revenue projections, policy changes, and new priorities.

The MTEF exists because government cannot plan effectively on a one-year horizon. Building a hospital takes three to five years. Training teachers takes four years. Designing and implementing a new social programme requires multi-year commitment. The three-year framework gives departments, provinces, and municipalities a degree of certainty about future funding — not absolute certainty, because the outer-year figures are indicative and can be revised, but enough to plan capital projects, staffing, and programme delivery over a medium term.

The practical significance for you is this: the budget decisions that will affect your services in 2028 are already being shaped in 2026. When you read the budget documents, do not just look at the coming year's numbers. Look at the outer-year projections. If funding for provincial health is projected to decline in real terms over the medium term, that tells you something about where your clinic's staffing levels are heading — even if the coming year's allocation looks stable. The MTEF makes it possible to see the fiscal future before it arrives.

## Phase 1: Strategic Planning — Where Priorities Are Set (April to July)

The budget cycle begins not with money but with priorities. In the months following the start of a new financial year (which runs from 1 April to 31 March), national departments are required to develop and update their strategic documents. These documents — the five-year Strategic Plan and the annual Annual Performance Plan (APP) — define what each department intends to achieve and how it plans to use its budget allocation.

The strategic planning process is coordinated by two institutions. The Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation (DPME) oversees the alignment of departmental plans with the Medium-Term Strategic Framework (MTSF), which is government's five-year implementation plan derived from the National Development Plan (NDP). National Treasury oversees the alignment of departmental plans with available fiscal resources through the MTEF.

During this phase, departments are effectively answering two questions simultaneously: "What should we be doing?" (the DPME question) and "What can we afford to do?" (the Treasury question). These questions do not always produce the same answer. A department's strategic plan may identify infrastructure backlogs that require R50 billion over five years, but the MTEF may indicate that the department's total allocation over five years will be R30 billion. The gap between strategic ambition and fiscal reality is where the political negotiations begin.

The strategic planning phase is largely invisible to citizens. It happens inside departments, in bilateral discussions between departments and Treasury, and in technical committees that do not hold public hearings. But its outcomes are visible: the APPs that departments table in Parliament alongside the budget in February are the products of this phase. When you read an APP and find that a department has set a target of building 200 new classrooms (down from 350 the previous year), the reduction likely reflects a fiscal constraint imposed during the strategic planning phase — a constraint that was negotiated months before the budget was tabled.

## Phase 2: The Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement — The Preview (October)

The first public moment in the budget cycle comes in October, when the Minister of Finance tables the Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS) in Parliament. The MTBPS is the fiscal preview — a document that sets out the government's fiscal policy framework, revises the economic and revenue outlook, and provides updated medium-term expenditure projections.

The MTBPS does not contain detailed departmental allocations. That comes in February. What it does provide is the fiscal framework — the macroeconomic assumptions (GDP growth, inflation, exchange rate), the revised revenue projection, the intended expenditure ceiling, the projected budget deficit, and the borrowing requirement. It also signals major policy shifts that will be reflected in the February budget: if the government plans to introduce a new social grant, adjust the tax structure, or impose austerity measures on departmental spending, the MTBPS is where these signals first appear.

For citizens who follow the money, the MTBPS is arguably more important than the budget speech itself. By October, the fiscal framework is largely set. The total amount available for spending has been determined. The division between spheres has been preliminarily agreed. The big policy choices — how much to spend, how much to borrow, how much to allocate to debt service versus service delivery — are visible in the MTBPS. The February budget fills in the detail, but the MTBPS establishes the boundaries within which that detail must fit.

The MTBPS is tabled in Parliament and referred to the Standing Committee on Finance and the Standing Committee on Appropriations in the National Assembly, and to the Select Committee on Finance and the Select Committee on Appropriations in the National Council of Provinces (NCOP). These committees hold hearings at which National Treasury presents the fiscal framework and members can ask questions. The Financial and Fiscal Commission (FFC) submits its response to the MTBPS, and civil society organisations — such as the Budget Justice Coalition, the Institute for Economic Justice, and the Public Service Accountability Monitor — publish analyses and submit commentary. These hearings and submissions are public and open.

:::takeaway
The MTBPS in October is where the fiscal boundaries are set. If you want to influence the budget, do not wait until February. The MTBPS establishes the total spending envelope, the borrowing plan, and the broad allocation priorities. By the time the budget speech happens in February, the major fiscal choices have already been made. The Standing Committee on Finance and the Standing Committee on Appropriations hold public hearings on the MTBPS — this is one of the earliest and most significant opportunities for citizens to engage with the budget process.

## Phase 3: Budget Preparation — The Negotiation Nobody Sees (August to January)

Between August and January, National Treasury conducts the most consequential phase of the budget cycle: the bilateral budget discussions with individual national departments. This is where the actual numbers are decided — how much each department will receive, which programmes will be funded, which will be cut, and which conditional grants will flow to provinces and municipalities.

The process works like this. National Treasury issues a budget circular to all national departments, setting out the MTEF guidelines, the fiscal constraints, and the timelines for submissions. Each department submits its budget proposal — its request for funding, justified by its strategic plan and APP targets. Treasury officials then engage in bilateral discussions with each department, examining the proposals line by line, challenging assumptions, testing whether the requested funding is justified by performance data, and negotiating the final allocation within the available fiscal envelope.

These bilateral discussions are the black box of the budget process. They are not public. They are not broadcast. There are no transcripts. The negotiations happen between Treasury officials and departmental officials, with the Minister of Finance and the relevant ministers resolving disputes that cannot be settled at the official level. The Ministers' Committee on the Budget (MinComBud), chaired by the Minister of Finance and comprising a small group of senior Cabinet ministers, adjudicates the most significant allocation disputes and makes recommendations to Cabinet. Cabinet approves the final budget allocations, typically in January or early February, just weeks before the budget is tabled.

The opacity of this phase is both a feature and a problem. It is a feature because budget negotiations require candid assessments of departmental performance and capacity — assessments that officials would be reluctant to make in public. It is a problem because it means the most consequential fiscal decisions are made behind closed doors, with no opportunity for public input. By the time Parliament receives the budget in February, the allocations have been finalised. Parliamentary committees can scrutinise, question, and criticise, but the political reality is that Parliament has never rejected a budget tabled by the executive.

:::expert
The Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO), established by the Money Bills Amendment Procedure and Related Matters Act of 2009, was created specifically to address the information asymmetry between the executive and the legislature in the budget process. The PBO provides independent analysis and advice to parliamentary committees, enabling them to scrutinise the budget with something closer to the technical depth that National Treasury brings to its preparation. In its annual assessments of the fiscal framework and departmental budgets, the PBO has consistently identified areas where departmental spending does not align with stated policy priorities — instances where a department's budget allocation has been cut in real terms while its mandate has expanded, or where capital expenditure has been deferred repeatedly, creating growing infrastructure backlogs that will cost more to address in the future. The PBO's analyses of the budget, published on the parliamentary website, are among the most technically rigorous publicly available assessments of government spending and provide an independent check on Treasury's assumptions and projections that citizens can access without needing specialised fiscal expertise.
:::

## Phase 4: Budget Day — What Actually Happens in February

Budget day is the most visible moment in the fiscal calendar. On a Wednesday in February (the exact date varies but is typically in the third or fourth week), the Minister of Finance delivers the budget speech in the National Assembly. The speech — broadcast live on national television and radio — announces the headline numbers: total revenue, total expenditure, the budget deficit, major tax changes, and key spending priorities. It is, by convention, the one day of the year when the entire country pays attention to public finance.

But the speech itself is the least important document tabled on budget day. The real information is in the accompanying publications, which run to thousands of pages and contain the granular data that matters for following the money.

The Budget Review is the flagship document — typically 200–300 pages covering the economic outlook, revenue proposals, expenditure plans, the fiscal framework, debt management strategy, and intergovernmental fiscal relations. It is written in relatively accessible prose (by government document standards) and is the single best overview of the government's fiscal position and plans.

The Estimates of National Expenditure (ENE) is the detailed companion document — one chapter for every national department, showing its budget allocation by programme, its expenditure trends over the medium term, its performance targets and achievements, and its planned spending for the coming three years. The ENE is where you can see, for example, that the Department of Basic Education plans to spend R30.6 billion on the Education Infrastructure Grant over the medium term, or that the Department of Health's budget for district health services has grown by a specific percentage. If the Budget Review tells you the big picture, the ENE tells you what each department is actually doing with its money.

The Division of Revenue Bill, as discussed in *Following the Money*, shows how nationally raised revenue will be divided among the three spheres — including the specific equitable share and conditional grant allocations to each province and each municipality.

The tax proposals — changes to personal income tax brackets, VAT, excise duties, and other taxes — are contained in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill and the Tax Administration Laws Amendment Bill, which are tabled separately and processed through their own parliamentary procedure.

All of these documents are published on the National Treasury website on budget day. They are public. They are free. And they contain more information about how your money will be spent than most citizens realise exists.

## Phase 5: Parliamentary Scrutiny — Where the Budget Is Examined (February to June)

Once the budget is tabled, Parliament's role begins. The parliamentary budget process is governed by the Money Bills Amendment Procedure and Related Matters Act of 2009 — a law that, for the first time, gave Parliament the formal power to amend the budget rather than simply approving or rejecting it. In theory, this makes South Africa's Parliament one of the more fiscally empowered legislatures in the world. In practice, the amendment power has been used cautiously, and Parliament has never made substantial changes to a tabled budget.

The parliamentary process unfolds in several stages.

### The Fiscal Framework and Revenue Proposals

The Standing Committee on Finance in the National Assembly and the Select Committee on Finance in the NCOP consider the fiscal framework — the overall spending envelope, borrowing plan, and revenue proposals. These committees hold hearings where National Treasury, the South African Reserve Bank, the FFC, and invited experts present their analyses. The committees may recommend changes to the fiscal framework, and the National Assembly adopts a fiscal framework resolution — effectively endorsing or amending the macroeconomic and fiscal parameters within which the rest of the budget must fit.

The revenue proposals (tax changes) follow a separate track. The Standing Committee on Finance holds public hearings on the proposed tax amendments, receives submissions from professional bodies, civil society organisations, and affected industries, and may recommend changes before the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill is passed. This is one of the most substantively meaningful public participation processes in the budget cycle — when a proposed tax change threatens a particular sector or group, the affected parties submit detailed representations to the committee, and amendments do sometimes result.

### Departmental Budget Votes

The centrepiece of parliamentary budget scrutiny is the budget vote process. Each national department's budget is referred to the relevant portfolio committee in the National Assembly. The portfolio committee holds hearings at which the minister and the department's senior officials present the budget, explain the allocation, and respond to questions from members of Parliament.

These portfolio committee hearings are where the most substantive engagement happens. A well-prepared committee member can use the ENE data, the Auditor-General's findings, and the department's own APP to ask pointed questions: why has the department underspent its infrastructure budget for three consecutive years? Why are the performance targets for this programme lower than last year despite increased funding? What happened to the conditional grant allocation that was supposed to fund water infrastructure in a specific municipality?

The quality of this scrutiny varies enormously across committees. Some portfolio committees — particularly those overseeing large spending departments like Health, Basic Education, and Police — have members with significant policy knowledge and support from the PBO. Others are less well-resourced or less rigorous. Party discipline also constrains scrutiny: members from the governing party may be reluctant to ask difficult questions of ministers from their own party, and opposition members may use the hearings for political theatre rather than substantive engagement.

After the hearings, the National Assembly votes on each department's budget allocation in a series of "budget votes." The Appropriation Bill — which gives legal effect to the budget — is then passed by the National Assembly and considered by the NCOP. Once both houses have approved the Appropriation Bill, the President signs it into law, and the departments have legal authority to spend the allocated funds.

:::expert
The Parliamentary Monitoring Group (PMG), which has tracked and documented parliamentary committee proceedings since 1998, provides the most comprehensive publicly accessible record of the budget vote process. PMG's records of portfolio committee hearings reveal the wide variation in scrutiny quality across committees. Their documentation shows that committees with active, technically informed chairpersons and engaged opposition members tend to produce the most substantive engagements — posing detailed questions that draw on Auditor-General findings, ENE data, and departmental performance reports. PMG's records also document a recurring structural problem: committee members frequently receive the budget documentation only days before the hearings, giving them insufficient time to analyse thousands of pages of technical fiscal information. The PBO's establishment has partially addressed this — its pre-hearing briefing notes help members identify the critical questions — but the time pressure remains. PMG makes the minutes, presentations, and submissions from every portfolio committee hearing publicly available at pmg.org.za, giving citizens access to the same information that parliamentarians use and enabling anyone to assess whether their elected representatives are asking the right questions about how public money is being spent.
:::

## Phase 6: Implementation and In-Year Monitoring (April to March)

Once Parliament has passed the Appropriation Act, the implementation phase begins. Departments, provinces, and municipalities start spending their allocations according to their APPs and budget plans. But the budget process does not pause during implementation — National Treasury monitors spending throughout the year through a system of in-year reporting.

National and provincial departments submit monthly expenditure reports to National Treasury, showing how much of their budget they have spent, by programme, against their planned spending profiles. These reports allow Treasury to identify underspending and overspending early — a department that has spent only 15% of its annual allocation by the end of the first quarter (when it should have spent roughly 25%) may be heading for significant underspending by year-end. Treasury can then engage with the department to understand the reasons and, if necessary, recommend corrective action.

Municipalities submit quarterly financial reports to National Treasury under the Municipal Finance Management Act (MFMA), showing their revenue collection, expenditure, and cash position. These reports are published on the National Treasury municipal finance website and are available for any citizen to access.

The in-year monitoring data matters because it is the earliest warning system for fiscal problems. If you check your municipality's quarterly reports and see that it has spent 90% of its operating budget in the first three quarters but collected only 60% of its budgeted revenue, you do not need to wait for the Auditor-General's report (which comes 12–18 months later) to know that the municipality is heading for a cash crisis. The in-year data is current, it is public, and it tells you what is happening now rather than what happened last year.

## Phase 7: The Adjustments Budget — The Mid-Year Correction (October to November)

In October or November each year — roughly six months into the financial year — the Minister of Finance tables an Adjustments Appropriation Bill, commonly known as the "adjusted budget" or "adjustments estimate." This is the government's mid-year fiscal correction, reflecting changes that have occurred since the main budget was tabled in February.

The adjustments budget serves several purposes. It incorporates the fiscal impact of events that could not be foreseen when the main budget was prepared — a natural disaster requiring emergency spending, a revenue shortfall caused by an economic downturn, or an unexpected expenditure demand like a court order requiring additional spending on a programme. It also reallocates unspent funds — shifting money from programmes where spending is behind schedule to programmes where additional funding is needed. And it provides the formal legal authority for spending changes that have already been made during the year under the emergency provisions of the PFMA.

The adjustments budget does not receive the same level of public or parliamentary attention as the main budget, but it often contains significant policy information. A department whose allocation is reduced in the adjustments budget is typically a department that has been underspending — an early signal of implementation problems. A large addition to a department's allocation may signal an emerging crisis or a policy priority that has escalated since February. Reading the adjustments budget alongside the main budget gives you a more accurate picture of what government is actually spending, as opposed to what it planned to spend.

## Phase 8: Year-End, Annual Reports, and the Audit Cycle (March to November)

The financial year ends on 31 March. In the months that follow, two critical accountability processes unfold.

### Annual Reports

Every national and provincial department is required to produce an Annual Report within five months of the financial year-end. The Annual Report is the department's own account of its performance — what it achieved against its APP targets, how it spent its budget, and what challenges it encountered. Departments table their Annual Reports in Parliament, typically in September or October, and the relevant portfolio committees hold hearings to examine them.

The Annual Report is a self-assessment — the department marking its own homework. This makes it useful but unreliable on its own. Departments have an incentive to present their performance in the most favourable light, to explain away missed targets, and to emphasise achievements while downplaying failures. The Annual Report becomes a powerful accountability tool only when read alongside the Auditor-General's report, which provides an independent assessment of whether the department's claims are accurate.

### The Auditor-General's Reports

The Auditor-General of South Africa (AGSA) audits every national department, every provincial department, and every municipality annually. The audit examines three things: the accuracy of the financial statements (did the department account for its money properly?), compliance with key legislation (did the department follow the rules for procurement, human resources, and financial management?), and the reliability of reported performance information (did the department actually achieve what it claimed to achieve in its Annual Report?).

AGSA publishes its findings in consolidated general reports — one for national and provincial government (under the PFMA) and one for local government (under the MFMA). These reports, typically released between November and June of the following year, are the most authoritative independent assessment of government financial management available. They are where you find the audit outcomes — clean audit, unqualified with findings, qualified, adverse, or disclaimer — that tell you at a glance whether an entity managed its finances properly.

The audit cycle has a significant time lag. The AGSA report on the 2024/25 financial year is typically published in late 2025 or early 2026. This means the most authoritative information about government performance is always 12–18 months old by the time you read it. The lag is inherent in the audit process — auditors need time to examine financial statements and verify performance information — but it means that the audit findings relate to a period that may already have seen significant changes. A department that received a qualified audit in 2024/25 may have improved by the time the report is published, or it may have deteriorated further. The audit is a snapshot, not a live feed.

:::takeaway
The budget cycle does not end when Parliament passes the Appropriation Act. Implementation monitoring, the adjustments budget, annual reports, and the Auditor-General's audit form a continuous accountability loop that runs year-round. The in-year expenditure data (published quarterly by Treasury) is the most current fiscal information available. The Auditor-General's reports are the most authoritative. A citizen who checks both — in-year spending data for current trends and audit reports for verified historical performance — has a more complete picture of government fiscal management than most elected officials.
:::

## The Role of the Financial and Fiscal Commission

The FFC deserves a dedicated discussion because its role in the budget process is both constitutionally mandated and widely misunderstood. Established under Section 220 of the Constitution, the FFC is an independent body that advises Parliament and provincial legislatures on financial and fiscal matters — including the annual Division of Revenue, the equitable share formulas, and the fiscal framework.

Each year, the FFC submits recommendations on the Division of Revenue to Parliament, typically in advance of the MTBPS. These recommendations analyse the fiscal needs of provinces and municipalities, assess whether the equitable share formulas adequately reflect those needs, and propose adjustments. The FFC also responds to the MTBPS and the budget itself, providing an independent fiscal perspective that may differ from National Treasury's position.

The FFC's recommendations are advisory — Parliament is not required to adopt them, and Treasury is not required to implement them. In practice, the FFC's technical analyses carry significant weight in the budget process, but its recommendations are frequently not implemented, or are implemented partially and with substantial modification. The FFC has, for example, recommended adjustments to the provincial equitable share formula to better account for rural service delivery costs, modifications to the local government equitable share formula to reflect updated poverty data, and changes to the conditional grant framework to reduce the administrative burden on municipalities with limited capacity. Some of these recommendations have been adopted over time; others have been acknowledged and deferred indefinitely.

For citizens, the FFC's publications are valuable precisely because they offer an independent perspective on the budget. When National Treasury says the fiscal framework is sustainable and the allocations are adequate, the FFC may disagree — and its disagreement is grounded in technical analysis, not political positioning. The FFC's submissions and recommendations are published on its website and are among the most accessible independent fiscal analyses available to the public.

## Where You Can Actually Engage: The Citizen's Entry Points

The budget process has multiple entry points for citizen engagement, but they vary dramatically in their effectiveness. Understanding which are meaningful and which are largely performative helps you direct your energy where it will have the most impact.

### Parliamentary Committee Submissions

When portfolio committees consider departmental budgets, they invite written and oral submissions from the public. Any citizen, civil society organisation, or interest group can submit commentary on a department's budget. In practice, this process is dominated by organised civil society — organisations like the Budget Justice Coalition, Section27 (which focuses on health and education rights), Equal Education, and the Black Sash (which monitors social grants) — that have the technical capacity to analyse budget documents and produce substantive submissions. But the right to submit is universal, and committees are constitutionally required to facilitate public participation.

The most impactful submissions are those that link budget data to service delivery outcomes — showing a committee that a department's budget allocation is insufficient for its mandate, or that a department has repeatedly underspent a specific programme, or that a conditional grant is not achieving its intended purpose. Generic submissions ("spend more on education") carry less weight than evidence-based submissions ("the Education Infrastructure Grant has been underspent by an average of 12% over the past three years, while 3,500 schools still lack adequate sanitation facilities, according to the AGSA's 2022/23 report").

### MTBPS Public Hearings

The Standing Committee on Finance holds public hearings after the MTBPS is tabled in October. These hearings are a significant opportunity to comment on the fiscal framework before the detailed budget allocations are finalised. Submissions at this stage can influence the overall fiscal direction — arguing for more resources for a specific sphere or function, or challenging the macroeconomic assumptions that underpin the revenue projections.

### Provincial Legislature Budget Processes

Provincial legislatures run their own budget processes, with portfolio committees scrutinising provincial departmental budgets and holding public hearings. Because provincial budgets fund the services closest to you — schools, hospitals, clinics, provincial roads — these provincial hearings are arguably more directly relevant to your life than the national process. Provincial public hearings tend to be less well-attended by civil society than national ones, which means that individual citizen submissions may receive more attention.

### Municipal Budget Processes

Municipal councils are required by the MFMA to table their annual budgets and Integrated Development Plans (IDPs) for public comment. Municipalities must hold public participation processes — typically community meetings and ward-level consultations — before adopting their budgets. The quality of these processes varies enormously. In well-resourced metropolitan municipalities, the budget consultation process includes published draft budgets, community meetings, and online submission portals. In under-resourced rural municipalities, the process may amount to a single community meeting with limited prior notice and no written documentation. The obligation exists in law; its implementation is uneven.

:::expert
Research by the International Budget Partnership (IBP), through its Open Budget Survey, consistently ranks South Africa among the top performers globally for budget transparency — the availability and timeliness of key budget documents. South Africa scores well because it publishes the pre-budget statement (MTBPS), the executive budget proposal, the enacted budget, in-year reports, the mid-year review, the year-end report, and the audit report — all of which are publicly available. However, the IBP's research also shows that South Africa scores significantly lower on public participation — the extent to which citizens can meaningfully influence budget decisions. The gap between transparency and participation is a recurring finding: the documents are available, but the mechanisms for citizens to translate information into influence are weak. The IBP's analysis identifies the budget preparation phase (the bilateral negotiations between Treasury and departments) as the most significant participation gap — a phase where consequential decisions are made entirely behind closed doors, with no formal mechanism for public input. The IBP recommends that governments create opportunities for public engagement before the executive budget is finalised, not just after it is tabled — a recommendation that South Africa has not yet implemented in any systematic way.

## The Budget Process in One Page: A Calendar Summary

Understanding the budget cycle is easier when you can see the full year at a glance. Here is the annual budget calendar, showing when each phase occurs and what documents or events to watch for.

April to July is the strategic planning phase. Departments develop their Annual Performance Plans and negotiate medium-term spending priorities with National Treasury. No public documents are produced during this phase, but the outcomes shape everything that follows.

August to October is the preparation phase. National Treasury conducts bilateral discussions with departments, negotiating specific allocations. The FFC submits its recommendations on the Division of Revenue. In October, the Minister of Finance tables the MTBPS — the first public fiscal document of the cycle.

November to January is the finalisation phase. The Ministers' Committee on the Budget resolves outstanding allocation disputes. Cabinet approves the final budget. National Treasury produces the budget documents — the Budget Review, the ENE, the Division of Revenue Bill.

February is budget month. The Minister of Finance delivers the budget speech and tables the budget documents. Parliamentary committees begin their scrutiny process.

March to June is the parliamentary phase. Portfolio committees hold hearings on departmental budgets. The Standing Committee on Appropriations considers the Appropriation Bill. Public submissions are received. The National Assembly and NCOP vote on the Appropriation Bill.

April marks the start of the new financial year. Departments begin spending their approved allocations. National Treasury begins in-year monitoring.

October to November brings the adjustments budget. The Minister tables the Adjustments Appropriation Bill, reflecting mid-year fiscal changes.

September to October is annual report season. Departments table their Annual Reports in Parliament. Portfolio committees hold hearings to examine departmental performance against their APPs.

November to June of the following year is audit season. The Auditor-General publishes consolidated audit reports for national, provincial, and municipal government. The Standing Committee on Public Accounts (SCOPA) holds hearings on the audit findings.

The cycle then begins again.

## SCOPA: The Committee That Follows the Money After It Is Spent

The Standing Committee on Public Accounts (SCOPA) occupies a unique position in the budget process. While other portfolio committees focus on policy and forward-looking budget allocations, SCOPA focuses backward — examining how departments actually spent their money, whether they complied with the law, and whether they achieved what they said they would achieve. SCOPA's mandate is to hold accounting officers (directors-general at national level, heads of department at provincial level, and municipal managers at local level) accountable for the financial management of the entities they lead.

SCOPA's hearings are based primarily on the Auditor-General's findings. When AGSA reports that a department incurred R2 billion in irregular expenditure, SCOPA summons the accounting officer and the minister to explain how it happened, what is being done to address it, and what consequences will follow. SCOPA has the power to recommend that accounting officers be held personally liable for financial losses, that disciplinary proceedings be initiated, and that matters be referred to law enforcement agencies.

The effectiveness of SCOPA depends on its independence from the executive — a historically contentious issue. SCOPA has traditionally been chaired by an opposition member, reflecting the principle that the committee responsible for holding the executive accountable should not be led by the executive's own party. This convention was disrupted during the 2014–2019 parliamentary term and subsequently restored, but the broader challenge remains: SCOPA's recommendations are not self-executing. It can recommend consequences, but implementing them requires political will from the executive — will that may not exist when the officials under scrutiny are politically connected.

For citizens, SCOPA hearings are among the most informative proceedings in Parliament. They are where the gap between budget allocations and actual spending is examined in detail, where the reasons for irregular expenditure are interrogated, and where accounting officers are required to explain themselves publicly. SCOPA's proceedings are documented by the Parliamentary Monitoring Group and broadcast on the parliamentary channel — making them accessible to any citizen who wants to see how their money was managed.

## The Budget Process You Do Not See: Provincial and Municipal Cycles

The national budget process described above has equivalents at provincial and municipal level, each with its own calendar, its own documents, and its own participation opportunities.

Provincial budgets are tabled by the provincial Member of the Executive Council (MEC) for Finance, typically in March (after the national budget has determined the province's allocation through DORA). Provincial budget documents include a provincial Budget Review, provincial Estimates of Expenditure (one chapter per provincial department), and the provincial Appropriation Bill. Provincial legislatures have portfolio committees that scrutinise departmental budgets, hold public hearings, and vote on the provincial Appropriation Bill. The provincial audit cycle follows the same pattern as the national cycle, with AGSA auditing every provincial department and the provincial Standing Committee on Public Accounts examining the findings.

Municipal budgets follow a different calendar. The MFMA requires municipalities to table their draft budgets by the end of March and adopt final budgets by the end of June. Before adoption, municipalities must publish their draft budgets for public comment and hold community participation processes. The municipal budget is closely linked to the Integrated Development Plan (IDP) — the municipality's five-year strategic plan, which is also subject to annual review and public participation. Municipal budget documents include the annual budget (with operating and capital components), the IDP, and the Service Delivery and Budget Implementation Plan (SDBIP), which breaks the annual budget into quarterly targets.

The municipal budget process is the level where individual citizen engagement can have the most direct impact. A submission to a portfolio committee at national level competes with dozens of well-resourced civil society organisations for attention. A submission at a municipal IDP or budget public participation meeting may be one of very few — and the officials in the room may have the direct authority to respond. If your ward has a specific infrastructure need — a road that needs repair, a water main that keeps bursting, a community facility that has been promised but not delivered — the municipal budget process is where that need can be translated into a funded project.

## The Budget Process and Your Practical Toolkit

:::toolkit
**The Budget Cycle Engagement Toolkit**

**Know the calendar.** The budget is a twelve-month process, not a single event. The most important moments for citizen engagement are the MTBPS in October (when the fiscal framework is set), the portfolio committee hearings in March to May (when departmental budgets are scrutinised), and the municipal budget public participation process in April to June (when local budgets are finalised).

**Read the right documents.** You do not need to read thousands of pages. Start with three documents: the Budget Review executive summary (for the big picture), the ENE chapter for the department you care about most (for departmental detail), and the Division of Revenue Bill annexure showing your province's or municipality's allocation (for local relevance). All are available at [treasury.gov.za](https://www.treasury.gov.za) on budget day.

**Check the MTBPS in October.** The Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement signals the fiscal direction before the detailed budget is finalised. Read the fiscal framework section and the expenditure projections. If provincial or municipal allocations are projected to grow below inflation, your services are being cut in real terms — even if the nominal numbers go up. The FFC's response to the MTBPS, available at [ffc.co.za](https://www.ffc.co.za), gives you an independent assessment.

**Follow in-year spending.** National Treasury publishes quarterly expenditure data for national and provincial departments, and municipal quarterly financial reports are available at [municipaldata.treasury.gov.za](https://municipaldata.treasury.gov.za). Check whether your municipality is spending on track and collecting revenue as budgeted. Significant deviations from the budget — underspending, revenue shortfalls, cash flow problems — are early warning signs that do not require an audit report to detect.

**Submit to Parliament.** When portfolio committees hold hearings on departmental budgets, submit written commentary. Focus on linking budget data to service delivery outcomes: "Department X was allocated R5 billion for Programme Y but underspent by 20% last year while [specific service delivery outcome] remains unachieved." The Parliamentary Monitoring Group at [pmg.org.za](https://pmg.org.za) publishes committee schedules and tells you when hearings are happening and how to submit.

**Engage your municipality's budget.** Attend the IDP and budget public participation meetings in your ward between April and June. Come prepared with specific requests: a costed infrastructure project, a service delivery gap documented with data, or a question about why a previous commitment was not fulfilled. Municipal officials are required to respond to public submissions — use this to create a documented record you can follow up on.

**Use SCOPA proceedings.** If your department or municipality received a poor audit outcome, check whether SCOPA (national) or the provincial Standing Committee on Public Accounts has held hearings. PMG documents these proceedings. The questions asked by committee members — and the answers given by accounting officers — often reveal more about the causes of financial mismanagement than the audit reports themselves.

**Compare allocation to outcomes.** The most powerful analysis any citizen can perform is comparing what was budgeted, what was spent, and what was achieved. The ENE shows what was budgeted. The Annual Report shows what was achieved. The Auditor-General's report tells you whether the financial and performance claims are credible. The gap between these three documents is the accountability gap — and identifying it is the first step toward closing it.

## Where to Go From Here

You now understand the complete budget cycle — from strategic planning in April through the MTBPS in October, budget day in February, parliamentary scrutiny in March to June, implementation monitoring, the adjustments budget, and the annual audit. You know which documents matter, when they are published, and where to find them. You know where citizens can engage and which entry points are most meaningful. And you know that the budget is not a single day in February but a continuous twelve-month process with specific decision points where the fiscal choices affecting your life are made.

In *From Treasury to Your Town*, the next article in this series, we will follow the money from national allocation to municipal service delivery — tracing how the equitable share and conditional grants move through the provincial and municipal fiscal systems and what happens to them along the way. The budget process creates the allocations. The question is what happens after the money leaves Treasury.
