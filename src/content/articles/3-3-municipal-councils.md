## The Government You Can Walk To

In *The Awkward Middle Child*, you learned that provinces are constitutionally powerful but fiscally dependent—a middle layer of government that most citizens struggle to distinguish from national government. In *Health and Education at the Provincial Coal Face*, you followed 80% of provincial spending into schools and clinics and saw how implementation quality determines whether your child learns and your clinic has medicine. This article takes you to the sphere of government that should be the easiest to understand, the most directly accountable, and the most responsive to your daily life: your municipal council.

Here is the bottom line: your municipal council is the only level of government you can physically walk to. It meets in a building in your town or city. Its ward councillor lives in your neighbourhood. Its decisions determine whether your water runs, your streetlights work, your refuse is collected, and your roads are maintained. The municipal council is the elected body that is supposed to govern your municipality—approving budgets, passing by-laws, overseeing the mayor and the municipal administration, and representing your interests in the decisions that shape your daily environment. It is also, in a significant number of South Africa's 257 municipalities, the level of government where democratic governance most visibly breaks down: where councils collapse into factional warfare, where oversight is weakest, where coalitions implode, and where the distance between what the law requires and what actually happens is widest. Understanding how your municipal council is supposed to work—and why it so often does not—is the most practically useful piece of governance knowledge you can have.

## Three Categories of Municipality: Why the Type Matters

Before you can understand your council, you need to understand which kind of municipality you live in. South Africa has 257 municipalities, but they are not all the same. The Constitution and the Municipal Structures Act 117 of 1998 establish three categories, each with a different governance structure, different powers, and a different relationship to your daily life.

### Category A: Metropolitan Municipalities

Category A municipalities are the eight metropolitan municipalities—the large urban centres that have exclusive municipal authority in their areas with no district municipality above them. They are the City of Johannesburg, the City of Cape Town, the City of Tshwane (Pretoria), eThekwini (Durban), Ekurhuleni (the East Rand), Nelson Mandela Bay (Port Elizabeth), Mangaung (Bloemfontein), and Buffalo City (East London). Together, these eight metros are home to approximately 40% of South Africa's population and generate the overwhelming majority of municipal own revenue nationally. If you live in a metro, your metro council is the only municipal council that governs you—there is no district layer above it.

Metropolitan councils are large. The City of Johannesburg council has 270 councillors. The City of Cape Town has 231. These councils manage budgets in the tens of billions of rands, oversee administrations employing tens of thousands of people, and govern populations larger than those of several countries. The scale of metropolitan governance creates specific challenges: council meetings are unwieldy, committee systems are complex, and the administrative machinery is large enough that political oversight can struggle to penetrate its operations effectively.

### Category B: Local Municipalities

Category B municipalities are the 205 local municipalities that share authority with the district municipality in whose area they fall. If you live outside a metro, you live in a local municipality. These range enormously in size and capacity—from relatively well-resourced secondary cities like Stellenbosch, Drakenstein, or Rustenburg, with significant property tax bases and functional administrations, to tiny rural municipalities in the Eastern Cape or Limpopo with populations under 50,000, almost no own revenue, and administrations that struggle to perform basic functions. The smallest local municipalities may have councils of only 20–30 councillors and budgets under R500 million—a fraction of what a metro spends in a single department.

The local municipality is responsible for the services that most directly affect your daily life: water reticulation (distributing water from the bulk supply to your tap), electricity reticulation (distributing electricity from Eskom's grid to your home), refuse removal, local roads, stormwater drainage, and municipal planning. In practice, the quality of these services depends almost entirely on the local municipality's institutional capacity—which varies so dramatically across the country that generalising about "local municipalities" is as misleading as generalising about "schools."

### Category C: District Municipalities

Category C municipalities are the 44 district municipalities, each encompassing several local municipalities. The district municipality is the upper tier of the two-tier system that governs areas outside the metros. Districts were designed to perform functions that require coordination across multiple local municipalities or that are too technically demanding for small local municipalities to perform on their own: bulk water supply, integrated development planning across the district, municipal health services, firefighting (in areas where local municipalities lack capacity), and the promotion of tourism and economic development for the district as a whole.

In practice, the district-local relationship is one of the most confused aspects of South African local government. The original intention was that districts would provide technical support and coordination, while locals would deliver services directly to households. The reality has been persistent overlap, confusion about who is responsible for what, and regular conflicts between district and local municipalities over functions, funding, and authority. The national government has, over the past decade, moved to "authorise" certain local municipalities to perform functions originally assigned to districts—particularly water and sanitation—creating a patchwork where some local municipalities deliver water directly while others depend on their district municipality to do so. When your water supply fails, knowing whether the local or district municipality is responsible is the first step in knowing who to hold accountable—and that answer varies depending on where you live and what authorisations have been granted.

:::takeaway
South Africa has 257 municipalities in three categories: 8 metropolitan municipalities (large cities, no district above them), 205 local municipalities (sharing power with a district), and 44 district municipalities (coordinating across local municipalities). The type of municipality you live in determines who delivers your services, how your council is structured, and where accountability lies. If you live outside a metro, you may need to identify whether your local or district municipality is responsible for the specific service that concerns you—a question that does not always have an obvious answer.

## How Your Council Is Elected: The Mixed Electoral System

Municipal councils are elected through a mixed system that combines ward representation and proportional representation (PR). Understanding this system is important because the type of councillor—ward or PR—determines what that councillor owes you and how they should be held accountable.

### Ward Councillors

Half of the seats on a metropolitan or local municipal council are filled by ward councillors—individuals elected directly by the voters of a specific geographic ward. Each ward elects one councillor through a first-past-the-post system: the candidate with the most votes wins, regardless of whether they achieve an absolute majority. Ward councillors can be nominated by political parties or can stand as independents. In practice, the overwhelming majority of ward councillors are party candidates, though the number of independent candidates has grown—particularly in the 2021 local government elections, where voter disillusionment with established parties created space for independents and smaller parties.

Your ward councillor is, in the constitutional design, your direct representative on the council. They are supposed to know your area, understand your service delivery problems, communicate council decisions to you, and bring your concerns to the council. Section 73 of the Municipal Structures Act requires every municipality with ward councillors to establish ward committees—advisory bodies consisting of the ward councillor (as chairperson) and up to ten community members, elected or nominated by the ward's residents. Ward committees are supposed to be the institutional bridge between you and your council, providing a structured channel for community input into municipal decisions. We will return to ward committees later in this article.

The ward councillor's accountability is direct: if they fail to serve your area, you can vote them out at the next election and replace them with a different individual, regardless of party. This direct accountability link is the ward system's greatest strength—and it distinguishes ward councillors from PR councillors in a way that matters for your daily experience of local government.

### Proportional Representation Councillors

The other half of the council seats are filled through proportional representation. You vote for a party, and seats are allocated in proportion to each party's share of the total municipal vote. PR councillors are drawn from party lists submitted before the election. You do not choose which individual fills a PR seat—the party decides, by ranking candidates on its list. If a party wins ten PR seats, the first ten names on its list enter the council.

PR councillors do not represent a specific ward. They represent their party on the council. Their accountability runs to the party, not to a geographic community. If a PR councillor defies the party, the party can, under certain circumstances, replace them. This means PR councillors are, in practice, more responsive to party leadership than to voters—a structural feature, not a personal failing. The PR system ensures that the council's overall political composition reflects the electorate's party preferences, which is its democratic function. But it also means that half your council has no direct geographic constituency and no obligation to respond to your specific service delivery complaints.

### District Council Elections

District councils are elected differently. Forty percent of district council seats are filled by PR votes cast at the district level. The remaining sixty percent are filled by representatives appointed by the local municipalities within the district—meaning that local council members serve simultaneously on the district council. This indirect election system means that you do not directly vote for the majority of your district councillors. The consequence is that district councils are, by design, less directly accountable to voters than metropolitan or local councils—a structural weakness that has contributed to the relative invisibility and poor performance of many district municipalities.

## Types of Executive Systems: Who Actually Runs Your Municipality

The Municipal Structures Act provides for different types of executive systems in municipalities. The executive system determines who holds executive authority—the power to make day-to-day governance decisions, propose the budget, appoint senior managers, and direct the municipal administration. Understanding which system your municipality uses is essential to knowing who is responsible for the decisions that affect your life.

### The Executive Mayor System

Most metropolitan municipalities and many larger local municipalities use the executive mayor system. Under this system, the council elects an executive mayor from among its members. The executive mayor then appoints a mayoral committee from among the councillors—similar to how a president appoints a cabinet. The executive mayor and the mayoral committee exercise the municipality's executive authority, subject to the council's oversight.

The executive mayor system concentrates executive power in a single individual. The executive mayor sets the political direction, proposes the budget to the council for approval, oversees the municipal administration through the municipal manager, and is the public face of the municipality. The mayoral committee members function as political heads of municipal departments, similar to MECs in provincial government. The executive mayor can reshuffle or replace mayoral committee members, giving the mayor significant control over the political layer of the administration.

This concentration of power has advantages: it creates clear accountability (you know who is in charge), enables decisive action, and simplifies the chain of command. It also has risks: if the executive mayor is incompetent or corrupt, the damage is concentrated. The council's role in the executive mayor system is to oversee the mayor—to approve or reject the budget, to scrutinise executive decisions through committees, and to hold the mayor accountable through council debates and questions. Whether the council actually performs this oversight function effectively depends on the political dynamics within the council, which we will examine below.

### The Executive Committee System

Some municipalities—particularly smaller local municipalities—use the executive committee (exco) system. Under this system, the council elects an executive committee on a proportional basis, reflecting the political composition of the council. The executive committee exercises executive authority collectively. The mayor in an exco system chairs the executive committee but does not have the concentrated individual power of an executive mayor—decisions are made by the committee, not by the mayor alone.

The exco system was designed to be more inclusive: because the committee is proportionally composed, opposition parties are represented in the executive. The theory was that this would produce more consensus-based governance and prevent the winner-takes-all dynamic of the executive mayor system. In practice, the exco system has often produced slow decision-making, diffused accountability (no single person is clearly responsible), and political deadlock when committee members from different parties cannot agree. Many municipalities that originally used the exco system have since transitioned to the executive mayor system—a trend that reflects a national preference for concentrated, accountable executive authority at the municipal level.

### The Plenary System

The smallest municipalities—those with very small councils, typically in sparsely populated rural areas—may use a plenary system in which the full council itself exercises executive authority. There is no separate executive committee or executive mayor; the council governs as a whole. This system is rare and is used only where the municipality is small enough that the full council can function as an executive body.

:::expert
Professor Jaap de Visser, Director of the Dullah Omar Institute for Constitutional Law, Governance and Human Rights at the University of the Western Cape, has researched the evolution of South Africa's municipal executive systems extensively. His work, including publications through the Community Law Centre (now the Dullah Omar Institute) and contributions to the Local Government Bulletin, traces a structural tension in the design of local government: the Municipal Structures Act provides for multiple executive types, but the national trend has been toward the executive mayor model, which concentrates power and creates clearer lines of accountability. De Visser's analysis shows that the shift toward executive mayors was driven partly by efficiency arguments—executive mayors can act more decisively than committees—but partly by political incentives: the governing party in a municipality gains more control when executive power is vested in a single mayor it can discipline than when it is shared through a proportionally composed committee. The consequence, de Visser argues, is that the executive mayor system places enormous importance on the council's oversight capacity. When the council effectively scrutinises the executive mayor, the system works well—you get decisive leadership with democratic accountability. When the council fails to exercise oversight—because of party discipline, factional politics, or lack of technical capacity—you get concentrated power without accountability, which is a recipe for governance failure. The oversight capacity of the council, not the executive type alone, determines whether the system produces good governance.

## The Municipal Manager: Where Politics Meets Administration

The municipal manager is the most consequential administrative appointment in any municipality. Section 54A of the Municipal Systems Act 32 of 2000 designates the municipal manager as the head of the municipal administration and the accounting officer of the municipality. The municipal manager is appointed by the council (not by the mayor alone, though the mayor typically drives the process) on a fixed-term performance contract of up to five years.

The municipal manager's role is to translate the council's political decisions into administrative action. The council approves the budget; the municipal manager ensures it is spent. The council adopts the Integrated Development Plan (IDP); the municipal manager ensures it is implemented. The council passes by-laws; the municipal manager ensures they are enforced. The municipal manager also appoints and manages the Section 56 managers—the senior executives who head the municipality's major departments (finance, infrastructure, community services, corporate services, and so on). These Section 56 managers are, like the municipal manager, appointed on fixed-term performance contracts and are supposed to be qualified professionals selected on merit.

The reality departs from the design in ways that are consequential for your daily life. The appointment of municipal managers has become intensely politicised in many municipalities. The governing party or coalition treats the municipal manager position as a deployment opportunity—a post to be filled by a political loyalist rather than a qualified administrator. The Municipal Systems Act was amended in 2022 (through the Municipal Systems Amendment Act 3 of 2022) to strengthen minimum competency requirements for municipal managers and Section 56 managers, requiring specific qualifications and experience and prohibiting the appointment of individuals who do not meet these requirements. The amendment also prohibited councillors from being appointed as municipal managers within two years of leaving office—a measure aimed at the revolving door between political and administrative positions. But enforcement of these requirements has been uneven, and many municipalities continue to appoint municipal managers through processes dominated by political considerations rather than professional competence.

When the municipal manager is competent, professional, and supported by the council, the municipal administration can function effectively—budgets are spent properly, infrastructure is maintained, revenue is collected, and services are delivered. When the municipal manager is a political appointee without the skills for the role, or when the mayor and council interfere in administrative decisions that should be the municipal manager's responsibility, the administration breaks down. The Municipal Finance Management Act 56 of 2003 (MFMA) assigns specific financial management responsibilities to the municipal manager as accounting officer—including ensuring that the municipality does not incur unauthorised, irregular, or fruitless and wasteful expenditure. When a municipal manager fails in these responsibilities, the fiscal consequences cascade through the entire municipality: service delivery deteriorates, creditors go unpaid, infrastructure maintenance is deferred, and the municipality's financial position erodes.

The Auditor-General's annual local government audit reports consistently identify instability in the municipal manager position as one of the primary root causes of poor governance outcomes. Municipalities with stable, competent municipal managers who serve out their contracts perform better on virtually every indicator—audit outcomes, service delivery, financial management—than municipalities where the municipal manager changes every one or two years, or where the position is occupied by an acting appointee for extended periods. The municipal manager position is the hinge on which the entire municipal administration turns. When the hinge is broken, everything it supports collapses.

## How Council Actually Works: Meetings, Committees, and Decisions

Understanding the mechanics of council proceedings—how decisions are made, where oversight happens, and where citizens can participate—is practical knowledge that enables you to engage with your local government effectively.

### Council Meetings

The full council meeting is the supreme decision-making body of the municipality. The Municipal Structures Act requires the council to meet at least quarterly, though most councils meet monthly. Council meetings are presided over by the speaker—an elected councillor who chairs proceedings, maintains order, and manages the council's programme. The speaker is not the executive head; the speaker's role is procedural, similar to a parliamentary speaker.

Council meetings are where major decisions are formally taken: the approval of the annual budget, the adoption of the IDP, the passing of by-laws, the appointment of the municipal manager, and the approval of major contracts and policies. Decisions are typically taken by majority vote, though the Municipal Structures Act requires special majorities for certain decisions—including the adoption and amendment of by-laws, which requires a majority of the council members (not just those present).

Council meetings are supposed to be open to the public. Section 20 of the Municipal Systems Act requires municipalities to conduct their affairs in an open and transparent manner, and the rules of order adopted by most councils provide for public access to ordinary council meetings. In practice, public attendance at council meetings is rare—most citizens do not know when their council meets, where it meets, or that they have the right to attend. This is a lost opportunity: attending a council meeting is one of the most direct ways to observe how your elected representatives behave, how decisions are made, and whether your councillors are engaged or absent.

### Section 79 and Section 80 Committees

The real work of council oversight happens not in full council meetings but in committees. The Municipal Structures Act establishes two types of committees, each with a different function.

Section 79 committees are committees of the council. They are established by the council to assist with its legislative and oversight functions. The most important Section 79 committee is the Municipal Public Accounts Committee (MPAC), which we will examine separately below. Other Section 79 committees may cover specific portfolio areas—infrastructure, finance, community services—and are composed of councillors who scrutinise the performance of the relevant municipal department. Section 79 committees report to the council and derive their authority from the council.

Section 80 committees are committees established to assist the executive mayor or executive committee. They operate within the executive arm, advising the mayor on policy and helping to coordinate executive functions. In practice, the distinction between Section 79 and Section 80 committees is not always clear to councillors or the public, and some municipalities blur the lines—using the same committee structures for both oversight and executive support, which undermines the separation between the executive and the oversight function.

The effectiveness of the committee system determines the quality of council oversight. A municipality with well-functioning Section 79 committees—where councillors have access to departmental reports, can summon officials to answer questions, can conduct oversight visits to service delivery sites, and produce substantive findings and recommendations—will have stronger governance than one where committees exist on paper but meet irregularly, lack support staff, and produce no meaningful outputs. The quality of committee oversight is, in most municipalities, the weakest link in the democratic accountability chain.

### The MPAC: Municipal Public Accounts Committee

The MPAC is the single most important oversight committee in any municipality. It is the municipal equivalent of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts (SCOPA) at national level. The MPAC's core function is to examine the annual report and the Auditor-General's audit findings for the municipality, interrogate the reasons for any adverse findings, and recommend corrective action to the council.

The MPAC was not originally required by legislation—it was introduced through a National Treasury circular (MFMA Circular No. 32) and subsequently endorsed by the National Council of Provinces and COGTA as an essential component of municipal governance. Despite its importance, the MPAC's effectiveness varies enormously across municipalities. In well-functioning municipalities, the MPAC operates like a mini-SCOPA: it summons the municipal manager and senior officials, interrogates irregular expenditure and audit qualifications, follows up on previous recommendations, and tables reports that the council debates and acts on. In dysfunctional municipalities, the MPAC barely functions—it meets infrequently, lacks the technical capacity to interrogate financial statements, is chaired by a councillor with no financial literacy, and produces reports that the council ignores.

National Treasury and COGTA have invested in MPAC capacity building through training programmes and guideline documents, but the fundamental constraint is political: in a municipality where the governing party controls both the executive and the oversight committees, the MPAC's willingness to hold the executive to account depends on whether the council's political culture tolerates genuine scrutiny. Where party discipline trumps oversight, the MPAC becomes a rubber stamp—approving the annual report and the audit response plan without interrogating whether the underlying problems have been addressed. This is not a design flaw in the MPAC model. It is a political dynamic that no institutional design can fully overcome.

:::takeaway
Your municipal council makes decisions through full council meetings (where budgets, by-laws, and major appointments are approved) and through committees (where oversight of the administration happens). The MPAC is the most important oversight committee—it examines audit findings and holds officials accountable for financial management failures. The committee system is where oversight is supposed to happen, but in many municipalities, committees lack the capacity, independence, or political will to scrutinise the executive effectively.

## Council Oversight: The Gap Between Design and Practice

The Municipal Systems Act, the MFMA, and the Municipal Structures Act collectively create a detailed framework for council oversight of the executive and the administration. The council is supposed to approve the budget and monitor spending through quarterly reports. It is supposed to review the annual report and the audit outcomes. It is supposed to hold the executive mayor and the mayoral committee accountable through questions, debates, and committee scrutiny. It is supposed to ensure that the municipal manager and senior managers perform in accordance with their contracts and that irregular expenditure is investigated and consequences are imposed.

In practice, council oversight is the most consistent point of failure in South African municipal governance. The Auditor-General of South Africa, in successive annual local government audit reports, has identified weak oversight by councils as one of the three primary root causes of poor audit outcomes and poor service delivery—alongside instability in key leadership positions and inadequate consequence management. The pattern is remarkably consistent across audit cycles: councils approve budgets but do not monitor spending, review annual reports but do not interrogate audit findings, and receive MPAC recommendations but do not follow up on implementation.

Several structural factors explain why council oversight fails so persistently.

First, capacity. Many councillors—particularly in smaller and rural municipalities—lack the technical knowledge to scrutinise complex financial statements, procurement processes, and performance reports. Municipal budgets run to hundreds of pages. The MFMA's requirements are technically demanding. A councillor who does not understand the difference between unauthorised, irregular, and fruitless and wasteful expenditure cannot meaningfully interrogate the audit report. SALGA (the South African Local Government Association) and various national departments provide councillor training, but the training is often insufficient in depth and duration to equip councillors for genuine oversight of complex municipal operations.

Second, party discipline. In municipalities where a single party holds a strong majority, the councillors on oversight committees are members of the same party as the executive mayor they are supposed to oversee. The party's internal discipline mechanisms—the threat of being removed from the party list at the next election, the promise of promotion to the mayoral committee—create powerful incentives to protect the executive rather than scrutinise it. A councillor who publicly criticises the executive mayor's financial management risks being labelled disloyal and losing their position. This dynamic is not unique to any party—it operates wherever a single party dominates a council—but it is particularly damaging in the context of local government oversight because the stakes are direct and immediate: poor oversight leads to poor service delivery, which affects the councillor's own constituency.

Third, resources. Council committees need support staff—researchers, financial analysts, legal advisers—to prepare for meetings, analyse reports, and draft findings. Most municipal councils do not have adequate support staff for their committees. The speaker's office, which typically manages the council's programme, may have a small team that cannot provide substantive technical support to multiple committees simultaneously. Without professional support, councillors are left to interrogate complex technical matters with only their own knowledge and the information the administration chooses to provide—an asymmetry that favours the executive.

Fourth, political will. Oversight is, at its core, a political act. It requires councillors to ask uncomfortable questions, challenge powerful individuals, and accept the political consequences of public scrutiny. In municipal environments where patronage networks are strong, where council positions are stepping stones to other political opportunities, and where loyalty to the party or faction matters more than loyalty to the community, the political will for genuine oversight is weak. This is not a matter of individual courage—it is a systemic incentive problem that requires systemic solutions.

:::expert
COGTA (the national Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs) and National Treasury have jointly published *Guidelines for Municipal Public Accounts Committees*, establishing the framework within which MPACs should operate. These guidelines, supplemented by National Treasury's MFMA Circular No. 32 and subsequent circulars on oversight, outline the MPAC's mandate (examining the annual report, following up on audit findings, recommending consequence management), its composition (it should be chaired by an opposition councillor where possible, to strengthen independence), and its relationship to the council (MPAC recommendations should be tabled and debated in full council). The guidelines represent the gold standard for municipal oversight. COGTA and National Treasury's own assessments, however, show that compliance with these guidelines is uneven. A 2019 COGTA assessment found that while most municipalities had formally established MPACs, fewer than half were functioning effectively—holding regular meetings, producing substantive reports, and securing council adoption of recommendations. National Treasury's annual *State of Local Government Finances* report has reinforced this finding, showing that municipalities with active MPACs consistently achieve better audit outcomes than those with non-functional or absent MPACs. The correlation between MPAC functionality and audit outcomes is one of the strongest in the local government performance data—confirming that the oversight architecture works when it is actually used.

## When Councils Fail: Section 139 Interventions

Just as the Constitution provides for national intervention in failing provinces through Section 100, it provides for provincial intervention in failing municipalities through Section 139. This is the mechanism that the system activates when a municipal council is unable or unwilling to fulfil its constitutional obligations.

Section 139(1)(a) allows the provincial executive to issue a directive to the municipal council, describing the failure and setting out the required corrective steps. This is the lightest form of intervention—the municipality is told what to do but retains responsibility for doing it.

Section 139(1)(b) allows the provincial executive to assume the municipality's obligations to the extent necessary—a more invasive intervention in which the province takes over specific functions. The NCOP must approve this intervention within 180 days, and the intervention must end when the municipality can resume its obligations.

Section 139(1)(c), added by the Constitution Seventeenth Amendment Act of 2012, allows for the dissolution of the municipal council if exceptional circumstances warrant it—specifically, if the council cannot or does not fulfil its obligation to approve a budget or any revenue-raising measures necessary to give effect to the budget. Council dissolution is the nuclear option: it triggers a by-election within 90 days and installs an administrator to manage the municipality in the interim.

Section 139(5) addresses financial emergencies specifically. When a municipality faces a financial crisis—persistent material breach of financial commitments, serious financial problems from any source, or a real risk of such problems—the provincial executive can impose a financial recovery plan, and if the municipality does not comply, assume financial management responsibility.

The track record of Section 139 interventions is extensive and sobering. According to COGTA data, more than 70 municipalities have been placed under some form of Section 139 intervention since the advent of democratic local government. The results have been mixed at best. Some interventions have stabilised acute crises—restoring basic financial management, clearing backlogs in unpaid creditors, and re-establishing minimum service delivery. But the underlying pattern is depressingly familiar from the Section 100 provincial intervention experience: when the intervention ends, the same structural conditions that produced the failure reassert themselves. The political dynamics that led to the appointment of an incompetent municipal manager have not changed. The council that failed to exercise oversight has not acquired new skills. The revenue base that was insufficient before the intervention is insufficient after it. The municipality that was placed under administration often returns to administration within a few years.

This cycle—failure, intervention, partial recovery, withdrawal, renewed failure—is one of the defining patterns of South African municipal governance. It points to a fundamental limitation of the intervention model: interventions treat symptoms (financial collapse, service delivery breakdown) without addressing root causes (politicised appointments, weak oversight, fiscal unsustainability, and in many cases, the basic question of whether some of South Africa's smallest and most under-resourced municipalities are viable governance entities at all).

## Ward Councillors and Ward Committees: The Closest Link to You

Your ward councillor is, in the constitutional design, your most direct representative in the governance system. Unlike PR councillors, who represent their party, your ward councillor represents your geographic community. They are supposed to know your area's specific problems—the burst water pipe on the main road, the streetlight that has been out for six months, the illegal dumping site at the edge of the township—and to advocate for solutions within the council and the municipal administration.

The Municipal Structures Act requires every municipality with a ward system to establish ward committees for each ward. A ward committee consists of the ward councillor as chairperson and up to ten members who are supposed to represent the diversity of interests within the ward—community organisations, religious bodies, ratepayers' associations, women's groups, youth organisations, and other stakeholders. Ward committee members are not paid councillors—they serve voluntarily, though some municipalities provide modest stipends.

Ward committees are supposed to serve three functions. First, they are a channel for community input into municipal decisions: the ward committee brings community concerns to the ward councillor, who raises them in the council and its committees. Second, they are a channel for communication from the municipality to the community: the ward councillor and ward committee members are supposed to report back to the ward on council decisions, budget allocations, and service delivery plans. Third, they provide a structured forum for community participation in municipal planning, particularly the IDP process—the municipality is required to consult communities in developing its five-year integrated development plan, and ward committees are the primary vehicle for this consultation.

The reality of ward committees is deeply uneven. Research by the Dullah Omar Institute and SALGA has found that ward committees function effectively in a minority of municipalities—typically the metros and better-resourced local municipalities where councillor support systems are stronger and where civic organisations provide an active base for committee participation. In many municipalities, ward committees exist on paper but meet infrequently or not at all. Committee members may not understand their role. Meetings may be poorly attended. The ward councillor may treat the committee as a personal support base rather than a representative community forum—appointing supporters rather than genuinely representative members. In some areas, ward committees have been captured by party structures, turning them into extensions of the local party branch rather than independent community forums.

The structural problem is that ward committees have no independent power. They can advise, recommend, and raise concerns—but they cannot compel the council or the administration to act. Their effectiveness depends entirely on whether the ward councillor takes their inputs seriously and advocates for them, and whether the council and administration are responsive to ward-level concerns. When the system works—when a competent ward councillor chairs an active ward committee and the municipality is responsive—the ward committee becomes a powerful mechanism for community participation and local accountability. When it does not work, the ward committee is an empty structure that gives the appearance of participation without its substance.

## Coalition Governance: When No Party Wins Outright

The 2016 and 2021 local government elections fundamentally changed the political landscape of South African municipal governance. For the first time, a significant number of municipalities—including major metros—produced councils in which no single party held an outright majority. The result was coalition governance: parties that had competed against each other in the election were forced to negotiate governing arrangements to form executives, elect mayors, and pass budgets.

Coalition governance introduces a specific set of dynamics that affect how your council operates. In a single-party council, the governing party's internal decision-making determines the council's direction—the party caucus decides, and the council ratifies. In a coalition council, decisions require negotiation between coalition partners, each of which has its own policy preferences, patronage interests, and internal dynamics. The coalition agreement—a political document negotiated between parties after the election—determines who gets the mayoralty, who fills the speaker's position, who chairs which committees, and what policy priorities the coalition will pursue. These agreements are not legally binding documents; they are political compacts that hold only as long as the parties find it in their interest to honour them.

The experience of coalition governance in South African municipalities since 2016 has been turbulent. The City of Johannesburg, the City of Tshwane, Nelson Mandela Bay, and Ekurhuleni have all experienced coalition instability—motions of no confidence in mayors, coalition partners defecting to the opposition, council meetings disrupted or inquorate, and in some cases, governance paralysis lasting months. Nelson Mandela Bay became the most extreme case: the metro experienced multiple changes of executive mayor, extended periods without a functional executive, and budget approval crises that threatened the municipality's ability to pay creditors and deliver services. The City of Tshwane's council was ultimately dissolved in 2020 after sustained governance collapse.

Coalition instability is not an inevitable consequence of coalition governance—it is a consequence of the specific political culture and incentive structures that shape South African coalition politics. In many democracies, coalition governance is the norm, and coalitions govern stably for full terms. The South African experience has been characterised by weak coalition discipline, the absence of enforceable coalition agreements, and the willingness of small parties to use their kingmaker position to extract concessions under the threat of switching sides. The result is a governance environment in which the executive mayor governs under permanent threat, long-term planning is impossible because the coalition's survival is uncertain, and administrative appointments are driven by the need to satisfy coalition partners rather than by professional competence.

The consequences for service delivery are direct. A municipality consumed by coalition instability cannot focus on governance. Council meetings are consumed by political manoeuvring rather than service delivery oversight. Budget approval is delayed while coalition partners negotiate. Senior administrative appointments—including the municipal manager—are held hostage to coalition dynamics, producing vacancies and acting appointments that undermine administrative stability. The citizens of coalition-governed municipalities have, in several cases, experienced measurable declines in service delivery, financial management, and audit outcomes during periods of coalition instability—not because coalition governance is inherently bad, but because the South African political system has not yet developed the norms, agreements, and institutional mechanisms needed to make coalitions stable and functional.

Dr Curtly Sobey and Yul Derek Sobey, researchers affiliated with the Electoral Institute for Sustainable Democracy in Africa (EISA), have analysed the structural challenges facing coalition governance in South African municipalities. Their research, published through EISA's Working Paper Series and the *Journal of African Elections*, identifies a critical institutional gap: South Africa's municipal governance framework was designed for single-party government. The Municipal Structures Act's provisions for executive mayors, mayoral committees, and council oversight assume a governing party with a stable majority. The framework provides no statutory mechanism for coalition agreements, no legal protection against coalition defection, and no institutional structures designed specifically for multi-party governance. When coalitions form, they do so in an institutional vacuum—relying on political agreements that have no legal enforceability and no institutional support. The researchers argue that the growing prevalence of coalition governance requires legislative reform: provisions for formal coalition agreements with defined exit mechanisms, rules governing motions of no confidence (including cooling-off periods to prevent the revolving-door mayoralty experienced in several metros), and institutional support structures for multi-party executives. Without such reforms, the instability experienced in coalition municipalities is likely to persist and expand as electoral competition intensifies.

## The Money Connection: How Council Decisions Shape Your Services

In *From Treasury to Your Town*, you followed the money from National Treasury to your municipality and learned how the equitable share, conditional grants, and own revenue combine to fund municipal services. The council's role in this fiscal chain is critical: the council approves the budget, authorises spending, sets property rates and service tariffs, and oversees financial management. Understanding the council's fiscal powers—and their limits—connects your understanding of how councils work to the daily services you depend on.

Each year, the executive mayor (or executive committee) tables a draft budget for the upcoming financial year. The budget is prepared by the municipal administration under the municipal manager's direction, following a process prescribed by the MFMA. The draft budget must be tabled at least 90 days before the start of the financial year (which runs from 1 July to 30 June for municipalities). The council then has a period to consider the budget, during which the municipality must publish the draft budget for public comment. Community members, ratepayers' organisations, and other stakeholders can submit written comments and present oral submissions.

The council must approve the budget before the start of the financial year. If it fails to do so, the municipality faces a constitutional crisis—it cannot legally incur expenditure without an approved budget. This is one of the scenarios that can trigger a Section 139 intervention, including the dissolution of the council under Section 139(1)(c). The budget approval function is, in this sense, the council's most important power: the power of the purse.

The council also sets the municipality's property rates (through the municipal rates policy, governed by the Municipal Property Rates Act 6 of 2004) and approves the tariffs charged for municipal services—water, electricity, sanitation, and refuse removal. These tariff decisions directly affect what you pay each month. They also determine the municipality's revenue base: tariffs that are set too low will not cover the cost of providing services; tariffs that are set too high will drive non-payment and erode the revenue base from the other end. The council's tariff decisions are among the most consequential economic choices made at the local level.

Once the budget is approved, the council's role shifts to monitoring. The MFMA requires the municipal manager to submit quarterly budget and performance reports to the mayor and the council. These reports show whether the municipality is spending in line with the budget, whether revenue collection is on track, and whether service delivery targets are being met. Section 71 reports (submitted to National Treasury) and Section 52 reports (submitted to the mayor and the council) provide the data that enables oversight. A council that reads, interrogates, and acts on these reports can catch financial and service delivery problems early. A council that rubber-stamps them allows problems to compound until they become crises.

## Evaluating Your Council: A Practical Framework

How do you assess whether your municipal council is functioning effectively? The following framework draws on the same principle applied to provincial government in the earlier articles: evaluate what your council controls, understand what it does not control, and use publicly available data to form an informed judgement.

### What Your Council Controls

Your council controls the quality of governance decisions: whether the budget is adopted on time and reflects community priorities, whether tariffs are set at sustainable levels, whether the municipal manager and senior managers are competent professionals appointed on merit, whether oversight committees function actively, whether audit findings are addressed, and whether consequence management is applied when officials fail or act irregularly.

Your council controls the quality of representation: whether your ward councillor is accessible and responsive, whether ward committees function, whether council meetings are open and accessible, and whether councillors engage meaningfully with community concerns.

Your council controls the political environment: whether coalitions are stable enough to govern, whether factional politics override governance, and whether the council prioritises service delivery over internal power struggles.

### What Your Council Does Not Control

Your council does not control the fiscal framework. The equitable share allocation is determined nationally. Conditional grants come with nationally determined spending conditions. The municipality's own-revenue potential is constrained by its economic base—a rural municipality cannot generate the property rates and service charges that a metro can.

Your council does not control the institutional inheritance. Municipalities created from former homeland areas inherited weak administrative capacity, infrastructure backlogs, and thin revenue bases. These structural disadvantages persist and constrain what any council can achieve.

Your council does not control national policy decisions. Eskom's performance affects your electricity supply. National water infrastructure decisions affect your bulk water availability. National wage agreements affect your municipality's personnel costs. These are factors that shape municipal performance but lie beyond any council's control.

### Where to Find the Data

The Auditor-General's annual local government audit report (www.agsa.co.za) provides audit outcomes for every municipality. Look up your municipality's audit outcome and track it over time. A municipality that has moved from a disclaimer to a qualified opinion to an unqualified opinion is improving. One that has moved in the opposite direction is deteriorating.

National Treasury's *State of Local Government Finances and Financial Management* report (www.treasury.gov.za) provides financial data on every municipality—revenue collection rates, spending patterns, creditor management, and cash flow positions. Look for your municipality's revenue collection rate: a municipality that collects less than 85% of what it bills is in fiscal trouble.

COGTA's annual report and the Back to Basics programme monitoring data provide assessments of municipal governance quality, though these are less granular than the AGSA and Treasury data.

Your municipality's own annual report—which it is required by the MFMA to publish and make available—contains the performance information for the year, the audit outcome, and the council's response to audit findings. Your municipality's website should have this document, though website functionality varies widely across municipalities.

The Municipal Demarcation Board (www.demarcation.org.za) provides boundary and demographic data for every municipality—useful context for understanding your municipality's size, population, and economic characteristics.

### The Five Questions

When you evaluate your municipal council, ask these five questions. First, does the council have a permanent, qualified municipal manager, or has the position been filled by acting appointees—a sign of governance instability? Second, what is the municipality's AGSA audit outcome, and is it improving or deteriorating? Third, does the council's MPAC function—does it meet regularly, examine audit findings, and produce reports that the council acts on? Fourth, does your ward councillor hold ward committee meetings and report back to the community on council decisions? And fifth, is the council stable enough to govern—are budgets adopted on time, is the executive in place, and are council meetings taking place as scheduled?

These five questions will not capture every dimension of municipal governance, but they will tell you whether the basic machinery of democratic local government is functioning in your municipality. The municipal council is the closest level of government to your daily life. It deserves your attention, your scrutiny, and your participation—because when it works, it works for you, and when it fails, you are the first to feel it.
