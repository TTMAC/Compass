## Two Sectors, One Province, 80% of Every Rand

In *The Awkward Middle Child*, you learned that South Africa's nine provinces occupy a structurally awkward position—constitutionally powerful on paper but fiscally dependent on national transfers for more than 95% of their budgets. This article takes you inside the two sectors where that money actually goes, and where the consequences of provincial performance—good or bad—directly touch your life.

Here is the bottom line: if you want to understand what your provincial government actually does, you need to understand two sectors and only two sectors—basic education and health. Together, these two functions consume roughly 80% of every provincial budget in South Africa, according to National Treasury's annual Provincial Budget and Expenditure Review. Everything else your province does—agriculture, public works, roads, social development, sport and recreation, the office of the premier itself—fits into the remaining 20%. Provincial government is, in practice, a school-and-clinic delivery machine. The quality of your child's education and the reliability of your local public health facility are the single most consequential outputs of provincial governance. Evaluating your province means evaluating these two sectors. Everything else is secondary.

## What a Provincial Budget Actually Looks Like

To make the scale concrete, consider the Gauteng provincial budget for the 2024/25 financial year—the most recent available at the time of writing. Gauteng's total budget was approximately R161 billion. Of that, the Department of Education received approximately R65 billion—roughly 40% of the total provincial budget. The Department of Health received approximately R55 billion—roughly 34%. Together, these two departments absorbed 74% of Gauteng's total budget. Add the Department of Social Development (which delivers welfare services, early childhood development, and substance abuse programmes) and the figure crosses 80%.

The pattern holds across all nine provinces, regardless of size, economic base, or political leadership. In the Western Cape, education and health together consume approximately 76% of the provincial budget. In the Eastern Cape—a province with a weaker economic base and greater dependence on national transfers—education and health consume approximately 82%. In Limpopo, the figure is similar. The variation between provinces is a few percentage points in either direction. The structural reality is the same everywhere: your provincial government is primarily in the business of running schools and clinics. If it does those two things well, it is a well-performing province. If it does them poorly, no amount of success in agriculture or sport and recreation will compensate.

This concentration of spending in two sectors has a direct implication for accountability. When your provincial MEC for Finance tables the annual budget, the most consequential decisions are not about whether to allocate R50 million to road maintenance or R50 million to libraries. They are about whether the education and health departments can absorb the personnel cost increases from national wage agreements, whether there is enough money left over for textbooks and medicine after salaries are paid, and whether the capital budget for school and clinic infrastructure will be protected or sacrificed to fund operating costs. These are the fiscal decisions that determine the quality of your daily experience of provincial government—and they are overwhelmingly concentrated in two departments.

## Basic Education: The Largest Provincial Function

### Who Does What: National Versus Provincial Responsibilities

South Africa's basic education system operates on a split-responsibility model that you need to understand before you can assign blame or credit for how your child's school performs. The national Department of Basic Education (DBE) sets the curriculum (the Curriculum and Assessment Policy Statements, or CAPS), administers the national matric examinations, establishes norms and standards for school infrastructure and teacher qualifications, manages the national school nutrition programme framework, and provides overall policy direction. The DBE is, in governance terms, the architect.

Your provincial education department is the builder. It employs the teachers—roughly 400,000 teachers across approximately 23,000 public ordinary schools nationally, according to DBE data—manages school infrastructure, provides learner transport in rural areas, procures and distributes textbooks and learning materials, and oversees the daily administration of the education system in your province. When a teacher stands in front of your child's class, that teacher is a provincial employee, paid from the provincial education budget, managed through the provincial education department's human resources system.

This split creates a specific accountability challenge. The national government decides what your child should learn (the curriculum) and how the quality of learning will be measured (the matric examinations and national assessments). The provincial government decides how effectively those decisions are implemented—whether there are enough teachers, whether those teachers are in the right schools, whether the textbooks arrive on time, whether the school building has running water and functional toilets, and whether the learner transport system gets rural children to school reliably. When your child receives a poor education, the cause could lie at either level—a curriculum that is poorly designed (national), or a curriculum that is well designed but poorly implemented because the provincial department cannot hire enough qualified teachers, maintain school buildings, or distribute learning materials (provincial). In practice, South Africa's education challenges are overwhelmingly implementation challenges, not curriculum challenges.

### The Personnel Cost Squeeze

The single most important fiscal fact about provincial education is this: approximately 80–85% of every provincial education budget goes to compensation of employees—teacher salaries and benefits. This figure comes directly from National Treasury's Provincial Budget and Expenditure Review and is consistent across all nine provinces. It means that for every R100 your province spends on education, between R80 and R85 goes to paying the people who work in the system. The remaining R15–R20 must cover everything else: textbooks, stationery, school maintenance, learner transport, school nutrition, examination administration, and departmental overhead.

This ratio creates a structural vulnerability. Teacher salaries are not determined by your provincial government. They are negotiated nationally in the Education Labour Relations Council (ELRC), where the national government and teacher unions bargain over wages and conditions of service. When the ELRC agrees to a salary increase of, say, 7.5%, every provincial education department must absorb that increase from its existing budget—whether or not the provincial equitable share has grown by the same percentage. In years when wage increases exceed equitable share growth, provinces face a forced choice: increase class sizes by not replacing teachers who retire or resign, cut non-personnel spending on textbooks and maintenance, or overspend the budget and carry an unauthorised deficit into the next financial year.

This is not a theoretical problem. It is the lived fiscal reality of provincial education departments. When your child's school has no new textbooks this year, or the broken windows have not been repaired, or the learner transport contract was not renewed, the proximate cause is usually that the provincial education department ran out of non-personnel funding after paying salaries mandated by a national wage agreement. The provincial MEC for Education did not choose to neglect your child's textbooks. The fiscal architecture left no money for them.

### The Indicators That Matter: What to Measure and Why

Understanding how well your province delivers basic education requires looking at specific indicators—and understanding what each one does and does not tell you.

The matric pass rate is the most widely reported education indicator and the most misleading. South Africa's national matric pass rate has exceeded 70% for several years, and provincial premiers and MECs routinely celebrate improvements. But the headline pass rate obscures more than it reveals. First, the pass mark for many subjects is 30%—a level that no university or employer considers adequate. Second, the pass rate measures only those who sit the examination—it excludes the significant number of learners who dropped out of the system before reaching Grade 12. The Department of Basic Education's own data shows that of every 100 learners who enter Grade 1, roughly 50–60 reach Grade 12. The matric pass rate is calculated from the survivors, not from the full cohort. A province that pushes struggling learners out of the system before matric will have a higher pass rate than one that retains them—but the first province has not delivered a better education. It has simply made its failure less visible.

The bachelor's pass rate—the percentage of matric candidates who achieve the minimum requirements for university admission—is a more demanding indicator. Nationally, the bachelor's pass rate is typically between 28% and 38%, meaning fewer than four in ten matric writers qualify for university. Provincial variation is significant: the Western Cape and Gauteng consistently achieve the highest bachelor's pass rates, while the Eastern Cape and Limpopo achieve the lowest.

International assessments provide the most honest picture of education quality. South Africa participates in the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS), both administered by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA). The results are sobering. In TIMSS 2019, South African Grade 5 learners scored an average of 374 in mathematics, against an international centre point of 500. In PIRLS 2016, 78% of South African Grade 4 learners could not read for meaning in any language—a statistic that has been widely cited by education researchers and that captures the depth of the early-grade learning crisis more powerfully than any matric pass rate.

These results reflect a system where the crisis is not in Grade 12 but in Grades 1–3, where foundational literacy and numeracy skills are supposed to be established. By the time learners reach high school, the gaps opened in primary school are often too wide to close. Provincial education performance should therefore be evaluated not only by matric results but by early-grade learning outcomes, which are measured through domestic systemic evaluations and the international assessments.

School infrastructure is another critical indicator. The 2013 Regulations Relating to Minimum Uniform Norms and Standards for Public School Infrastructure (the "Norms and Standards") set legally binding requirements for school buildings: every school must have access to water, electricity, and sanitation; there must be adequate classrooms relative to enrolment; and specific infrastructure hazards (including structures made entirely of inappropriate materials) must be eliminated by specified deadlines. Progress has been slower than the regulations require. As of recent DBE infrastructure reports, there are still schools without reliable water supply, schools using pit latrines (which pose both health and safety risks—several children have died in pit latrine collapses), and schools with classroom backlogs that force double-shift teaching. The infrastructure backlogs are concentrated in the provinces that absorbed former homeland territory: the Eastern Cape, Limpopo, KwaZulu-Natal, and the North West.

Learner transport is a less visible but critical indicator of provincial education performance. In rural provinces, the distance between a child's home and the nearest school can be significant—10, 15, or 20 kilometres. Without reliable learner transport, children either walk (exposing them to fatigue, safety risks, and weather), arrive late (missing instruction time), or do not attend at all (dropping out). Provincial education departments are responsible for providing learner transport, but the service varies enormously in quality and coverage. The Eastern Cape and Limpopo have faced persistent problems with learner transport contracts—late payments to operators, operators cancelling services, and children stranded without transport. These failures directly affect attendance, which directly affects learning outcomes.

Dr Nic Spaull, an education economist at Stellenbosch University's Research on Socio-Economic Policy (RESEP) unit, has published extensively on the learning crisis in South African primary schools. His research, drawing on large-scale datasets from TIMSS, PIRLS, the Annual National Assessments, and the National Income Dynamics Study (NIDS), has documented what he describes as "two education systems in one country": a functional system serving approximately 25% of learners (predominantly in former Model C schools and well-resourced urban schools) and a dysfunctional system serving the remaining 75% (predominantly in historically disadvantaged schools, many in former homeland areas). Spaull's analysis shows that the gap between these two systems opens in the first three years of schooling and widens with every subsequent year. By Grade 4, many learners in the dysfunctional system are already two to three years behind the curriculum in reading and mathematics. This early-grade deficit, Spaull argues, is the root cause of the high dropout rate, the low bachelor's pass rate, and South Africa's poor performance on international assessments. The policy implication is that provincial education departments should prioritise early-grade literacy and numeracy interventions above all other education investments—because by the time learners reach high school, the damage done in primary school is largely irreversible. Spaull has also shown that teacher content knowledge is a significant predictor of learner outcomes, and that in some provinces, a substantial proportion of mathematics teachers cannot correctly answer the questions they are expected to teach.

## Health: Where Provincial Government Meets Your Body

### Who Does What: National Versus Provincial Responsibilities

The health sector follows a similar split-responsibility model to education, with national government setting the framework and provinces delivering the services. The national Department of Health sets health policy, regulates the health professions (through the Health Professions Council of South Africa), manages the National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS), coordinates the response to disease outbreaks, oversees the proposed National Health Insurance (NHI) framework, and manages certain specialised and tertiary services in partnership with university medical schools.

Your provincial health department is responsible for the public health facilities you actually use. It runs the district health system—the network of primary healthcare (PHC) clinics and community health centres that provide the first point of contact for most South Africans accessing public healthcare. It operates the provincial hospitals: district hospitals (the smallest, providing basic inpatient care), regional hospitals (providing more specialised services), and tertiary and central hospitals (providing highly specialised services, typically linked to university medical schools). It manages emergency medical services (ambulances). It employs the doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and allied health professionals who staff these facilities.

When you arrive at your local clinic and wait three hours to be seen, when your chronic medication is out of stock, when the ambulance takes 90 minutes to reach you after an accident—these are provincial health failures. The national department sets the policy that says you should receive prompt, reliable, quality healthcare. Your provincial department determines whether you actually do.

### The Indicators That Tell the Truth

Facility audit outcomes from the Office of Health Standards Compliance (OHSC) are the most direct measure of the quality of the public health facilities in your province. The OHSC, established under the National Health Amendment Act, conducts inspections of public health facilities against a set of norms and standards covering patient safety, clinical governance, clinical care, patient experience, leadership, and infrastructure. The OHSC's inspection reports are publicly available and show that compliance varies dramatically: some facilities in the Western Cape and Gauteng achieve scores above 80%, indicating functional, patient-centred care, while facilities in the Eastern Cape and North West score below 40%, indicating fundamental failures in safety, cleanliness, and clinical care.

Medicine availability is an indicator that directly affects your health outcome. When your clinic does not have the antiretroviral medication, the insulin, or the blood pressure tablets you need, your condition deteriorates—and the deterioration is the province's responsibility. The Stop Stockouts Project (SSP), a civil society initiative that monitors medicine availability at public health facilities, has documented persistent stockout patterns in several provinces. Their data shows that essential medicines—including antiretrovirals, contraceptives, and chronic disease medications—experience stockouts at rates that vary significantly by province, with the weakest provincial supply chain systems producing the most frequent and prolonged shortages.

Maternal mortality is one of the most sensitive indicators of health system quality, because maternal deaths are overwhelmingly preventable with adequate obstetric care. South Africa's institutional maternal mortality ratio—the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in health facilities—has been a persistent concern. The Confidential Enquiry into Maternal Deaths (the Saving Mothers reports, published periodically by the National Department of Health) has identified avoidable factors in the majority of maternal deaths: delayed access to emergency obstetric care (often because the ambulance arrived too late or the referral hospital was too far), inadequate monitoring during labour, and missed warning signs that a competent clinician would have caught. Provincial variation in maternal mortality is significant and tracks the broader pattern of provincial capacity: the Western Cape and Gauteng have the lowest maternal mortality ratios, while the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal have the highest.

HIV/AIDS treatment coverage is a critically important indicator for South Africa, which has the world's largest antiretroviral treatment (ART) programme. More than 5.8 million people were on antiretroviral treatment in South Africa as of recent UNAIDS and national Department of Health data—the largest number of any country globally. The ART programme is a genuine success story of the South African public health system, having dramatically reduced AIDS-related mortality since the programme's scale-up began in the mid-2000s. But coverage and retention on treatment vary by province: provinces with stronger health systems achieve higher rates of viral suppression (meaning the treatment is working), while provinces with weaker systems lose patients to follow-up—they start treatment but drop out because of long distances to clinics, stockouts of medication, or inadequate adherence support.

Healthcare worker vacancies tell you whether your province can actually staff the facilities it runs. The health sector faces a national skills shortage—there are not enough doctors, specialist nurses, pharmacists, and allied health professionals to fill all the posts in the public health system. But the shortage is unevenly distributed. Urban facilities in Gauteng and the Western Cape have lower vacancy rates and can attract professionals who prefer urban living conditions. Rural facilities in the Eastern Cape, Limpopo, and KwaZulu-Natal struggle to fill posts: doctors appointed to rural hospitals often serve for only a year or two before transferring to urban areas, leaving chronic vacancies that directly reduce the facility's capacity to provide care. The community service programme—which requires newly qualified doctors, pharmacists, and other professionals to serve one year in a public facility—provides a temporary supply, but it does not solve the structural distribution problem.

### The Medico-Legal Claims Crisis

The medico-legal claims crisis deserves specific attention because it represents a fiscal risk that threatens to overwhelm provincial health budgets. Medico-legal claims are legal claims by patients (or their families) against provincial health departments for harm suffered due to medical negligence—a botched surgery, a delayed diagnosis, a birth injury caused by inadequate obstetric care. These claims have grown exponentially over the past decade. Gauteng's contingent liability from medico-legal claims exceeded R130 billion by recent estimates—a figure that exceeds the province's entire annual health budget. KwaZulu-Natal faces claims in the tens of billions. Nationally, the total contingent liability across all provincial health departments has been estimated at over R100 billion.

These are contingent liabilities, meaning they represent potential future payments, not current expenditure. But when courts order settlements, the money must come from the provincial health budget—diverting funds from actual healthcare delivery to compensate for past healthcare failures. The crisis is self-reinforcing: underfunded hospitals produce worse clinical outcomes, worse outcomes generate more negligence claims, and more claims drain more money from the health budget, further underfunding the hospitals. Several provinces have established dedicated medico-legal claims units and are pursuing alternative dispute resolution to reduce legal costs, but the underlying problem—clinical quality in under-resourced facilities—requires investment, not just legal strategy.

:::expert
The Health Systems Trust (HST), a South African non-governmental organisation focused on strengthening the health system, publishes the *South African Health Review* (SAHR) annually—the most comprehensive independent assessment of the country's health sector. The SAHR compiles data from multiple sources, including the District Health Information System (DHIS), the OHSC, the National Department of Health, and provincial health departments, providing cross-provincial comparisons on key indicators: facility utilisation rates, patient waiting times, immunisation coverage, maternal and child mortality, HIV/AIDS treatment outcomes, and health worker availability. HST's analysis in successive editions of the SAHR has documented a persistent "two-tier" dynamic within the public health system that mirrors the pattern in education: a functional tier of facilities (predominantly in the Western Cape and Gauteng, and in metropolitan areas generally) that delivers care approaching acceptable standards, and a struggling tier (predominantly in rural provinces and deep rural areas within all provinces) where facilities fail to meet basic norms and standards. HST's data shows that the variation between provinces on most health indicators is larger than the variation between South Africa and comparable middle-income countries—meaning that the difference in health outcomes between the Western Cape and the Eastern Cape is greater than the difference between South Africa's national average and that of countries at similar income levels. The implication is that South Africa's health crisis is not primarily a resource crisis (the country spends a relatively high share of GDP on health) but a governance and management crisis—the resources exist, but they are not being translated into outcomes equitably across provinces.

## How Provinces Compare: The Performance Map

The variation between provinces on education and health indicators is not random. It follows a consistent pattern that reflects structural factors—economic base, institutional inheritance, political dynamics, and demographic composition.

### Education Performance Across Provinces

The Western Cape consistently produces the strongest education outcomes. Its matric pass rate is typically the highest or second highest nationally, but more importantly, its bachelor's pass rate and the quality of passes (measured by distinctions in mathematics and physical science) are consistently the strongest. The Western Cape's advantage is partly historical—the province inherited a relatively well-functioning education administration from the pre-1994 Cape Provincial Administration—and partly the result of sustained provincial policy choices: investment in literacy and numeracy interventions in early grades, systematic monitoring of school performance through provincial assessment data, and active management of underperforming schools.

Gauteng produces strong absolute numbers—more bachelor's passes than any other province—but its performance relative to its resources and its urbanised, comparatively advantaged population is less remarkable. Gauteng faces the specific challenge of rapid population growth from in-migration, which strains school capacity and creates demand for new schools faster than the province can build them.

The Free State has achieved notable improvements in matric outcomes over recent years, emerging as a consistent performer despite a relatively small and economically constrained province—demonstrating that provincial leadership and management can produce results even within the constraints of fiscal dependence.

The Eastern Cape, Limpopo, and KwaZulu-Natal consistently produce the weakest education outcomes on most indicators. These are also the provinces with the largest inherited school infrastructure backlogs, the most dispersed rural populations (requiring the most extensive learner transport), and the most significant personnel distribution challenges (difficulty placing and retaining qualified teachers in rural and remote schools). The correlation between historical homeland territory and contemporary education performance remains stark three decades after the end of apartheid.

### Health Performance Across Provinces

The health performance map follows a similar geography, with additional nuances. The Western Cape has the lowest maternal mortality ratio, the highest OHSC facility compliance scores, and the best-staffed public health facilities—benefiting from the Cape Town metropolitan area's concentration of academic hospitals and health professionals, as well as a provincial health administration that has maintained relatively stable leadership and management systems.

Gauteng faces the unique pressure of serving a population that exceeds its provincial boundaries—patients from neighbouring provinces and neighbouring countries access Gauteng's hospitals because they are better equipped than those closer to home. This creates a demand pressure that the equitable share formula, based on Gauteng's resident population, does not fully compensate for.

KwaZulu-Natal has a particularly heavy disease burden—the province has been the epicentre of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, with some districts recording the highest HIV prevalence rates in the world. The provincial health department has scaled up its ART programme significantly, but the scale of the epidemic means that the health system absorbs a larger share of its resources on HIV/AIDS treatment than any other province, crowding out investment in other health services.

The Eastern Cape and Limpopo face the compounding challenge of weak infrastructure, high vacancy rates, and the geographic dispersion that makes service delivery inherently more expensive per capita. A clinic that serves a scattered rural population in the former Transkei costs more to staff, supply, and maintain than a clinic in a dense urban township—but the equitable share formula provides the same per-capita funding.

## The Human Story: What Systemic Failure Looks Like at the Frontline

Behind every provincial education and health statistic is a frontline worker—a teacher or a nurse—who experiences the consequences of systemic performance or systemic failure daily. Understanding the frontline experience is essential because it is at this level that policy, budgets, and institutional capacity are translated (or fail to be translated) into the services you receive.

Consider a teacher at a primary school in a rural area of the Eastern Cape. Her school has 47 learners in her Grade 2 class—well above the ideal of 30–35 specified in national norms. She has one set of readers for every three learners. The school's water supply is intermittent; on some days there is no water for the toilets, and the school closes early. She has not received the workbooks that the DBE distributes nationally—they arrived at the district office but have not been transported to her school because the district's vehicle fleet is not operational. She has completed one professional development session in the past year, delivered by a subject adviser who visited the school for a single day. She teaches reading in isiXhosa—her learners' home language—but the official assessment at the end of the year will test them in English, a language in which most of her learners cannot construct a complete sentence. Her challenges are not attributable to one failure. They are the accumulation of multiple systemic shortfalls, each traceable to a different part of the governance architecture: inadequate infrastructure (a provincial capital budget failure), insufficient learning materials (a provincial procurement and distribution failure), too many learners per class (a provincial personnel budget failure), and insufficient teacher support (a provincial and district management failure).

Now consider a professional nurse at a primary healthcare clinic in a peri-urban area of Limpopo. Her clinic is supposed to operate with four professional nurses, but two posts are vacant—one has been vacant for 18 months because the provincial health department has not processed the appointment. She sees 60 to 80 patients on a busy day. The clinic's supply of metformin (for diabetes) ran out ten days ago; diabetic patients are being told to come back next week. The cold chain for vaccines has broken down because the clinic's refrigerator is not functioning and the request for a replacement, submitted four months ago, has not been processed. A pregnant woman arrives in early labour, but the ambulance she called two hours ago has not arrived—the district's emergency medical services vehicle is being repaired. The nurse manages the delivery herself, in a clinic not equipped for obstetric emergencies, knowing that if something goes wrong, the patient's family may file a negligence claim that will add to the province's medico-legal liability. Her competence is not the issue. The system around her is failing, and she is managing the failure at the point where it touches human bodies.

These stories are not exceptional. They are representative of conditions in a significant proportion of schools and clinics in the provinces that face the most severe capacity constraints. The frontline workers in these environments are not lazy or incompetent—many are highly dedicated professionals working in conditions that would test anyone. The failures they experience are systemic: they originate in provincial budget decisions, national wage negotiations, procurement systems, supply chain management, infrastructure maintenance backlogs, and human resources processes that cannot fill vacancies in time. Holding the individual teacher or nurse accountable for outcomes that their system makes impossible is unfair. Holding the provincial government accountable for creating and maintaining a system that enables frontline workers to do their jobs—that is the right standard.

:::expert
The Auditor-General of South Africa, in the annual *PFMA Consolidated General Report* covering national and provincial government departments, tracks a set of indicators that directly reflect the quality of provincial administration in education and health. AGSA's analysis consistently identifies three root causes that drive poor audit outcomes—and, by extension, poor service delivery—in provincial education and health departments: instability in key leadership positions (HODs and CFOs appointed in acting capacities for extended periods, creating governance vacuums), weak supply chain management (procurement processes that either stall—delaying the delivery of textbooks, medicines, and equipment—or deviate from regulations, producing irregular expenditure), and inadequate consequence management (officials responsible for financial losses, irregular spending, or performance failures are not held to account, removing the incentive for compliance). AGSA's data shows that the provinces with the most stable leadership, the strongest internal controls, and the most consistent consequence management are also the provinces with the best audit outcomes and the best service delivery indicators. The correlation is not coincidental: administrative quality drives both fiscal accountability and service delivery outcomes. AGSA has recommended that provinces treat leadership stability and consequence management as preconditions for service delivery improvement—because no amount of additional funding will produce better outcomes in a department where the leadership is unstable, the controls are weak, and there are no consequences for failure.

## The Funding Gap: Why More Money Is Necessary But Not Sufficient

A persistent question in South Africa's education and health debates is whether the problem is insufficient funding or inefficient spending. The answer is both—but the proportion differs by province and by sector.

South Africa spends approximately 6.5% of GDP on education—above the international average and above most comparable middle-income countries. It spends approximately 8.5% of GDP on health (combining public and private expenditure)—also above comparators. In aggregate, the country does not underspend on these sectors. The problem is how the money is spent and how the outcomes compare to the investment.

In education, the personnel cost squeeze described earlier means that the money is overwhelmingly consumed by salaries, leaving insufficient funding for the non-personnel inputs (textbooks, infrastructure, teacher development) that drive learning quality. In health, the medico-legal claims crisis, combined with an inefficient mix of services (too many patients presenting at expensive hospital emergency departments for conditions that should be managed at cheaper PHC clinics), means that the available funding does not stretch as far as it should.

But there are also genuine funding gaps. The equitable share formula is based on demographic data that may undercount rapidly urbanising populations—Gauteng consistently argues that its allocation does not reflect the actual number of people using provincial services, many of whom have migrated from other provinces. Rural provinces face higher per-unit costs for service delivery—transporting a learner 30 kilometres to school costs more than transporting one 5 kilometres, and staffing a clinic that serves 200 people costs the same as staffing one that serves 2,000, but the per-capita cost is radically different.

The question for you as a citizen is not whether your province needs more money (it probably does) but whether your province is making the best possible use of the money it has. A province that underspends its conditional grants, accumulates irregular expenditure, and allows critical posts to remain vacant for years cannot credibly argue that its failures are purely a funding problem. A province that spends efficiently, fills posts promptly, maintains clean audits, and still cannot deliver adequate services has a stronger claim for additional resources. The AGSA audit outcome and the National Treasury expenditure data are the tools that allow you to distinguish between these two scenarios.

## Your Province's Education and Health Report Card: Where to Look and What to Look For

Evaluating your province's education and health performance requires specific data from specific sources. Here is a practical guide to the most important data sources and what to look for in each.

### Education Data

The Department of Basic Education publishes matric results by province every January following the examination. Look beyond the headline pass rate. Check the bachelor's pass rate, the number of distinctions in mathematics and physical science (indicators of quality, not just quantity), and the dropout rate between Grade 10 and Grade 12 (which indicates how many learners the system lost before they could sit the examination). These figures are available on the DBE's website at www.education.gov.za.

The DBE also publishes the School Masterlist—a database of every public and independent school in the country, with data on enrolment, educator numbers, and in some cases infrastructure. The Masterlist is available for download and allows you to check the learner-to-teacher ratio at your child's school and compare it to national and provincial averages.

For school infrastructure, the Norms and Standards for School Infrastructure progress reports (published periodically by the DBE) show how many schools still lack water, electricity, or adequate sanitation. The non-governmental organisation Equal Education has campaigned extensively on school infrastructure and publishes accessible analyses of the data.

For learning quality below matric level, the most honest data comes from the international assessments. TIMSS and PIRLS results are published by the IEA (www.iea.nl) and are analysed in the South African context by researchers at institutions like Stellenbosch University's RESEP unit and the University of the Witwatersrand.

### Health Data

The Office of Health Standards Compliance publishes facility inspection reports on its website (www.ohsc.org.za). You can search for the inspection results of specific facilities in your province to see how your local clinic or hospital scored against national norms and standards.

The Health Systems Trust's annual South African Health Review (www.hst.org.za) provides cross-provincial comparisons on a wide range of health indicators, including maternal and child health, HIV/AIDS programme performance, health worker availability, and facility utilisation. The SAHR is freely available online and is the single most useful document for comparing health performance across provinces.

The District Health Information System (DHIS) data, while not always easily accessible to the public, feeds into the health indicators published in the SAHR and in the national Department of Health's annual reports. Key indicators to look for: immunisation coverage rates (your province should be achieving above 80% coverage for routine childhood immunisations), antenatal care coverage (the proportion of pregnant women who receive at least four antenatal visits), and the proportion of HIV-positive patients on ART who are virally suppressed (indicating that the treatment programme is working).

The AGSA's annual PFMA audit report (www.agsa.co.za) includes audit outcomes for your provincial education and health departments. A department that receives a qualified opinion or a disclaimer is a department where the financial management has broken down—and financial management breakdown almost always correlates with service delivery breakdown.

National Treasury's annual Budget Review and the Provincial Budget and Expenditure Review (www.treasury.gov.za) show how your province allocated spending between personnel, goods and services, transfers, and capital—and whether it under- or overspent its budget. Look for the capital expenditure ratio: if your province is spending less than 5% of its education or health budget on capital (infrastructure), it is not investing in the physical systems that deliver services.

### The Questions to Ask

When you look at this data, ask five questions. First, is your province spending its education and health budgets fully, or is it underspending on capital and conditional grants while overspending on personnel? Second, what are your province's AGSA audit outcomes for the education and health departments—and are they improving or deteriorating over time? Third, how does your province compare to others on education quality indicators (bachelor's pass rate, TIMSS/PIRLS scores) and health quality indicators (OHSC compliance, maternal mortality, medicine availability)? Fourth, are the HOD and senior management positions in your province's education and health departments filled on a permanent basis, or are they occupied by acting officials—a sign of governance instability? And fifth, is your provincial legislature actively interrogating education and health department performance through committee oversight—and are those committee reports publicly available?

These five questions will not tell you everything, but they will tell you the most important things. Provincial education and health delivery is where the largest share of your tax money goes, and it is where provincial government performance matters most to your daily life. You now have the tools to judge whether that money is being well spent.
