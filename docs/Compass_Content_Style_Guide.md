## 1. Purpose of This Guide

This Content Style Guide is the single reference for anyone writing, editing, or reviewing content for the Compass blog. It ensures every article delivers a consistent reading experience that is conversational, data-anchored, non-partisan, and practically useful to the target audience. All content decisions should trace back to a principle in this document, which in turn traces back to validated user needs documented in the Compass MRD, PRD, and UXD.

Use this guide when writing new articles, editing drafts, briefing contributors, reviewing content for publication, or resolving disagreements about tone, structure, or word choice.

## 2. Who We Write For

### 2.1 Primary Reader Profile

Our primary reader is a working-age South African (25–45) in the urban middle segment. They are formally employed or running a small business, primarily based in Gauteng metros (Johannesburg, Tshwane, Ekurhuleni). They earn a household income of R8,000–R29,000 per month. They have completed Matric and may hold a diploma or certificate. They own a smartphone (likely a mid-range Android), use prepaid mobile data, and consume content primarily in English via WhatsApp (88% penetration) and social media.

They experience service delivery failures daily — water outages, potholes, load shedding, under-resourced clinics — and are frustrated with government. But they cannot distinguish whether their ward councillor, their provincial MEC, or a national minister is responsible. They are politically dealigned: suspicious of all parties, represented by none, and increasingly likely to abstain from voting rather than make an uninformed choice.

They are not apathetic. They are uninformed and underserved. This distinction is fundamental to everything we write.

> **Key insight:** Our reader is intelligent but uninformed about governance structures. Never condescend. Never assume prerequisite knowledge. Always respect their intelligence while filling the knowledge gap.

### 2.2 Reader Circumstances

Our reader struggles most in three recurring moments, and every piece of content should help with at least one of them:

| Struggling Moment | What the Reader Needs |
|---|---|
| **"Who do I blame?"** — A service fails and they cannot identify the responsible sphere of government. | A clear mental model for tracing accountability: is this national, provincial, or municipal? |
| **"Election decision"** — An election approaches and they have no framework for evaluating incumbent performance. | Access to performance data and the knowledge to interpret it — audit outcomes, spending patterns, service delivery metrics. |
| **"Is this normal?"** — They encounter a failure and cannot tell whether it reflects systemic dysfunction or an isolated incident. | Benchmarks and context: what does a well-run municipality look like vs. one in financial distress? |

### 2.3 What Our Reader Is Not

Our reader is not an academic, a policy professional, a journalist, or a governance expert. They are not looking for academic rigour, theoretical frameworks, or comprehensive legal analysis. They want to understand the system well enough to make informed decisions and hold the right people accountable. Write for the nurse in Soweto, the retail manager in Centurion, the small business owner in Mamelodi — not for the policy analyst in Pretoria.

---

## 3. Brand Attributes

Every sentence must reflect these five brand attributes. They are not aspirational — they are constraints. If a piece of content violates any of them, it does not publish.

| Attribute | What It Means for Content |
|---|---|
| **Trustworthy** | Sources are always visible and linked. Claims are anchored in data. No speculation presented as fact. No clickbait. No sensationalism. In a low-trust environment, trust is earned sentence by sentence. |
| **Empowering** | The reader leaves with agency, not just knowledge. Every article ends with practical tools: a framework, a checklist, a data source, a complaint mechanism. We do not just explain — we equip. |
| **Accessible** | Complex governance concepts made legible to intelligent non-experts. The O'Reilly register: conversational, specific, practical. Technical terms are explained on first use. Jargon is earned, never assumed. |
| **Serious** | This is civic education, not entertainment. No gamification, no hype words, no emoji in article body text. The design and writing communicate that the content matters. |
| **Non-partisan** | Rigorously neutral. No party alignment, no editorial opinion on partisan questions. Data speaks; the reader decides. We report what the Auditor-General found — we do not editorialize about which party caused it. |

---

## 4. Voice and Tone

### 4.1 The Compass Voice

Think of the Compass voice as a knowledgeable friend who happens to be a governance expert — someone explaining the system over coffee, not lecturing from a podium. The register is modelled on O'Reilly technical books: authoritative but never academic, specific but never dry, practical but never patronising.

### 4.2 Core Voice Principles

**Direct address.** Always use "you" to address the reader. This is not optional. The reader is not a passive observer of governance — they are a participant in it. "Here's how this affects you" not "The implications for citizens are as follows."

**Lead with specifics.** Every section, every paragraph, every argument begins with a concrete example, a real number, or a specific institution — never with a generalisation. "In 2022/23, only 28 of 257 municipalities received clean audits from the Auditor-General" not "Many municipalities struggle with financial management."

**Bottom-line-up-front.** Every article opens with its core conclusion in the first two paragraphs. The reader should know the main takeaway before they commit to reading 5,000 words. This is not a mystery novel — give away the ending first, then explain why it's true.

**Conversational authority.** Write like you know the material deeply and are explaining it to someone who deserves to understand it. Authoritative but warm. Confident but never arrogant. The voice of a teacher who respects their students, not a professor who talks over them.

**Honest assessment.** Be candid about what works and what doesn't in South Africa's governance system. If the NCOP has become a rubber stamp, say so. If Section 139 interventions rarely succeed, say so. The reader trusts us because we do not sugar-coat — but we also do not catastrophise. Balance critique with acknowledgement of where the system functions.

### 4.3 Tone by Context

| Context | Tone | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Article body** | Conversational, authoritative, direct | Here's how this affects you: when your water stops running, the first question is whether it's a bulk supply issue (national/water board) or a reticulation issue (your municipality). Here's how to tell the difference. |
| **Success / completion** | Warm, genuine, understated | You now have the tools to look up your municipality's audit outcome and understand what it means. That puts you ahead of most people — including many elected officials. |
| **Error / recovery** | Supportive, solution-focused | Something went wrong on our end. Please try again — and if it keeps happening, let us know at hello@compass.co.za. |
| **Empty states** | Inviting, action-oriented | This article is coming soon. In the meantime, start with The Architecture of the State — it explains how South Africa's Constitution divides power. |
| **Email notifications** | Respectful, brief, useful | Subject: "Following the Money — New on Compass." One-sentence hook plus direct article link. No marketing fluff. |

## 5. Writing Rules

### 5.1 Structure

**Article length:** Minimum 5,000 words. This is long-form civic education, not a blog post. The length is deliberate — it signals depth and seriousness. If a topic cannot sustain 5,000 words of substantive, non-repetitive content, it is not a Compass article.

**Bottom-line-up-front opening:** Every article opens with its core conclusion in the first one to two paragraphs. State the takeaway clearly and directly. Then spend the rest of the article proving and explaining it.

**Flowing prose only:** No bullet points in article body text. Write in paragraphs. Lists break the conversational register and signal lazy thinking. If you need to present a set of items, weave them into natural prose: "Several factors drive this pattern: the thin revenue base, the inability to attract professional staff, and the dependence on national transfers that can exceed 90% of total revenue."

**Expert anecdotes:** Every article includes two to three short anecdotes from named South African experts — M&E practitioners, public policy scholars, governance researchers from institutions like DPME, SAMEA, Twende Mbele, PARI, HSRC, or universities (Wits, UCT, Stellenbosch). These ground the analysis in practitioner reality.

**Practical toolkit ending:** Every article concludes with a practical section: a mental model, a checklist, a set of data sources with guidance on what to look for, or a complaint mechanism walkthrough. The reader must leave with something they can use immediately.

**Cross-references:** Articles reference each other where relevant. Use the article title as the link text: "As we explored in Following the Money, the equitable share formula creates winners and losers among provinces."

### 5.2 Prose Style

**Sentence length:** Vary sentence length deliberately. Use short sentences for emphasis and impact. Use longer sentences for explanation and nuance. Monotonous sentence length — either all short or all long — kills readability.

**Paragraph length:** Keep paragraphs to three to five sentences. A wall of text is hostile to readers on mobile screens. White space is a trust signal.

**Active voice:** Default to active voice. "The Auditor-General audits every municipality annually" not "Every municipality is audited annually by the Auditor-General." Passive voice is acceptable when the actor is genuinely unknown or unimportant.

**Concrete over abstract:** Always choose the concrete word or example over the abstract one. "Pothole on your street" not "infrastructure deficit." "Your water stops running" not "service delivery challenges."

**Plain language:** Use the simplest word that conveys the precise meaning. "Use" not "utilise." "Because" not "in light of the fact that." "But" not "however, it should be noted that."

**Technical terms:** When a technical term is necessary (equitable share, MFMA, conditional grant, Section 139 intervention), define it on first use in plain language. After that, use it freely. Assume the reader will encounter these terms in government documents and needs to recognise them.

### 5.3 Data and Evidence

**Anchor claims in data:** Every substantive claim must be supported by a specific data point, a named source, or a cited document. "Only 28 of 257 municipalities achieved clean audits in 2022/23 (AGSA MFMA Report)" not "Many municipalities have poor audit outcomes."

**Use real numbers:** Wherever possible, use actual figures from recent DORA allocations, AGSA reports, DPME evaluations, StatsSA data, or National Treasury documents. Numbers make arguments concrete and verifiable.

**Source linking:** Link directly to the primary source document. When referencing an AGSA report, link to the AGSA website. When citing a Division of Revenue allocation, link to the National Treasury page. Never ask the reader to take your word for it.

**Recency:** Use the most recent available data. Government data cycles are predictable: AGSA reports are annual, DORA is annual, DPME evaluations are periodic. State the year of the data explicitly.

**Honesty about limitations:** If data is incomplete, contested, or old, say so. "The most recent municipal audit data available at the time of writing covers the 2022/23 financial year" is honest. Presenting old data without acknowledging its age is not.

## 6. Language Conventions

### 6.1 Spelling and Grammar

**British English:** Use British spelling throughout: "organisation" not "organization," "centre" not "center," "licence" (noun) not "license," "programme" not "program." This reflects South African English conventions.

**Oxford comma:** Use the Oxford comma (serial comma) for clarity: "national, provincial, and municipal."

**Em dashes:** Use em dashes (—) without spaces for parenthetical statements and asides. These are a natural part of the conversational register: "The system exists—the question is whether it functions."

**Numbers:** Spell out numbers one through nine; use numerals for 10 and above. Exception: always use numerals for data points, statistics, financial figures, and section references regardless of size ("3 spheres," "Section 139," "R8,000/month").

**Currency:** Use the format R followed by the amount with no space: R8,000, R29,000, R2.5 billion. For ranges: R8,000–R29,000.

**Percentages:** Use the numeral followed by the percent sign with no space: 21%, 85%, 44%.

**Dates:** Use the format day month year with no commas or ordinal suffixes: 15 February 2026, not February 15th, 2026.

**Financial years:** Use the format 2022/23 (not 2022–23 or 2022–2023) to match South African government convention.

### 6.2 South African Terminology

Use correct South African governance terminology consistently:

| Term | Usage Note |
|---|---|
| **Spheres** (not tiers) | The Constitution deliberately chose "spheres" to imply equality, not hierarchy. Never use "tiers" or "levels" of government. |
| **Municipality** (not council or local authority) | Use "municipality" for the institution. "Council" refers specifically to the elected body. "Local authority" is an outdated term. |
| **MEC** (not minister) | Provincial political heads are Members of the Executive Council, not ministers. Reserve "minister" for national Cabinet members. |
| **Ward councillor** | Two words, lower case unless referring to a specific named individual. |
| **Equitable share** | Lower case. This is the constitutional term for the unconditional allocation to provinces and municipalities. |
| **Conditional grant** | Lower case, unless referring to a specific named grant (e.g., the Municipal Infrastructure Grant). |
| **Section 139 intervention** | Always include "of the Constitution" on first use in each article. |
| **AGSA / Auditor-General** | Use the full title on first reference, then AGSA or "the Auditor-General" thereafter. |
| **Chapter 9 institutions** | Capitalise "Chapter" when referring to the constitutional chapter. Lower case "institutions." |
| **Clean audit / qualified / disclaimer** | Use AGSA's official audit outcome categories. Define each on first use. |

### 6.3 Abbreviations and Acronyms

Spell out in full on first use in each article, followed by the abbreviation in parentheses. Use the abbreviation thereafter. Common abbreviations used across the series:

| Abbreviation | Full Form |
|---|---|
| AGSA | Auditor-General of South Africa |
| DORA | Division of Revenue Act |
| DPME | Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation |
| FFC | Financial and Fiscal Commission |
| FOSAD | Forum of South African Directors-General |
| IDP | Integrated Development Plan |
| MFMA | Municipal Finance Management Act |
| MTSF | Medium-Term Strategic Framework |
| NCOP | National Council of Provinces |
| PAIA | Promotion of Access to Information Act |
| PFMA | Public Finance Management Act |
| SDBIP | Service Delivery and Budget Implementation Plan |
| StatsSA | Statistics South Africa |

## 7. What We Never Do

### 7.1 Banned Patterns

| Pattern | Why It's Banned |
|---|---|
| **Bullet points in article prose** | Breaks the conversational register. Signals superficial treatment. Weave lists into flowing paragraphs instead. |
| **Hype words** ("revolutionary," "game-changing," "groundbreaking") | Undermines trust and seriousness. Every word must earn its place. |
| **Academic register** ("it is submitted that," "the aforementioned") | Alienates the target reader. Write for humans, not for a journal submission. |
| **Corporate speak** ("stakeholder engagement," "synergies," "going forward") | Empty language that obscures meaning. Use plain words. |
| **Emoji in article body text** | Undermines the "Serious" brand attribute. Compass is civic education, not social media content. |
| **Passive voice as default** | Obscures who is doing what — which is exactly the problem Compass exists to solve. Name the actor. |
| **Unsourced claims** | Destroys trust. Every substantive claim needs a source. |
| **Partisan editorial opinion** | Destroys non-partisan positioning. Present data and let the reader draw conclusions. |
| **Clickbait headlines or framing** | Undermines trust. Titles should be descriptive and accurate, not manipulative. |
| **"Congratulations!" / "Well done!" / gamified language** | Patronising. The reader is an adult engaging in civic education, not a student collecting badges. |
| **Addressing the reader as "the citizen" or "residents"** | Use "you." Always "you." The second person is mandatory. |

### 7.2 Tone Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | What to Do Instead |
|---|---|---|
| **Lecturing** | Makes the reader feel small. Triggers the same "institution talking at me" reflex that kills trust. | Explain with them, not at them. "Let's walk through how this works" not "It is important to understand that." |
| **Catastrophising** | Feeds cynicism instead of agency. If everything is broken, why bother engaging? | Be honest about failures but always point to leverage: what works, what data is available, where the citizen has power. |
| **Both-sidesism** | Presenting a well-documented failure as "one perspective" is dishonest, not balanced. | Non-partisan means no party alignment. It does not mean pretending that a disclaimer audit and a clean audit are equivalent. |
| **Jargon gatekeeping** | Using technical terms without explanation excludes the reader and signals "this isn't for you." | Define every technical term on first use. Treat jargon as a tool to give the reader, not a barrier to keep them out. |

---

## 8. Standard Article Structure

Every Compass article follows this consistent structure. Deviations require explicit justification.

| Section | Requirements |
|---|---|
| **Title** | Descriptive, accurate, and compelling. Format: "[Vivid Phrase] — [What the Article Actually Covers]." Example: "Following the Money — How South Africa's Intergovernmental Fiscal System Actually Works." No clickbait. No questions as titles. |
| **Metadata line** | Reading time (calculated at word count ÷ 200 wpm), publish date, sphere tag (National / Provincial / Municipal / All Spheres), part number. |
| **Bottom-line-up-front opening** | One to two paragraphs stating the article's core conclusion. The reader should know the main takeaway before scrolling further. |
| **Body sections (H2/H3)** | Logically structured sections progressing from foundation to detail. Each section begins with a concrete example or data point. Expert anecdotes woven throughout (two to three per article minimum). |
| **Practical Framework / Toolkit section** | A distinct section at the end with actionable tools: a mental model, a data-source walkthrough with "what to look for" guidance, a checklist, or a complaint mechanism. Visually distinguished from body text (dashed border callout). |
| **Cross-references** | Links to related articles in the series where relevant. |

---

## 9. Callout Components

Three distinct callout types break up article body text and serve specific functions. Use them deliberately — they lose impact if overused.

| Callout Type | Purpose | Visual Treatment |
|---|---|---|
| **Expert Anecdote** | Attributed quote or narrative from a named practitioner or scholar. Grounds analysis in lived experience. | 4px compass-green left border, light background. Attribution includes name, role, and institutional affiliation. |
| **Key Takeaway** | Bottom-line-up-front summary for a section, or a critical insight the reader should remember. | Compass-gold left border, secondary background colour. One to three sentences maximum. |
| **Practical Toolkit** | Actionable guidance: data sources, complaint steps, evaluation frameworks. | Dashed compass-green border. Appears at the end of an article. Contains direct links to sources with "what to look for" guidance. |

---

## 10. Titles, Metadata, and Distribution

### 10.1 Article Titles

Titles follow the format: vivid phrase, em dash, descriptive subtitle. The vivid phrase hooks attention; the subtitle tells the reader exactly what they will learn. Keep the full title under 60 characters for SEO. Examples from the series: "Following the Money — How South Africa's Intergovernmental Fiscal System Actually Works" and "Who Watches the Watchers — South Africa's Oversight and Accountability Ecosystem."

### 10.2 Meta Descriptions

Write meta descriptions of 150–160 characters that summarise the article's practical value to the reader. Lead with "you" or a direct benefit. Example: "Learn exactly which sphere of government is responsible for your water, roads, and clinic—and how to check whether they're doing their job."

### 10.3 WhatsApp Share Text

Pre-filled WhatsApp share messages include: the article title, a one-sentence hook that makes the reader's contact want to tap the link, the UTM-tagged article URL, and the sign-off "— From Compass: Making SA's governance system legible." The hook should highlight practical value: "Did you know you can look up your municipality's audit outcome online? This explains how."

### 10.4 OG Image

Each article has a 1200×630px Open Graph image showing the Compass brand mark, the article title, and the sphere tag. The image must render clearly in WhatsApp link previews, which is the primary discovery channel for the target audience.

---

## 11. Accessibility Requirements

Compass articles must be accessible to readers with disabilities and to readers on constrained devices and connections. These are not aspirational targets — they are requirements.

| Requirement | Specification |
|---|---|
| **Heading hierarchy** | Strict H1 > H2 > H3 progression. Never skip levels. The heading structure is the article's skeleton for screen readers and the table of contents. |
| **Link text** | Descriptive, never "click here." "Read the AGSA's 2022/23 MFMA report" not "Click here for the report." |
| **Alt text** (if images added) | Descriptive alt text that conveys the information the image communicates. For data visualisations, describe the key finding. |
| **Plain language** | Target a Grade 10 reading level for body text. Technical terms are permitted when defined on first use. |
| **Page weight** | Total article page weight target: 200KB, hard limit: 400KB. The reader may be on prepaid data. Every kilobyte must justify its existence. |
| **Mobile readability** | Body text legible on a 360px screen without horizontal scrolling. Line length does not exceed approximately 75 characters. |

---

## 12. Editorial Principles

These principles govern how Compass treats politically sensitive content. They are non-negotiable and apply to every article, every callout, and every metadata description.

**Present data, not opinion.** When reporting audit outcomes, spending patterns, or performance metrics, present the data and its source. Do not editorialize about which political party caused the result. "Gauteng's health department received a qualified audit in 2022/23" is a fact. "Gauteng's ANC-led health department failed its audit" is a partisan framing of the same fact.

**Name institutions and roles, not parties.** Refer to "the Department of Water and Sanitation" or "the Minister of Water and Sanitation" rather than "the ANC's water department." When party affiliation is genuinely relevant to the analysis (e.g., when discussing coalition governance dynamics), state it factually without editorial loading.

**Acknowledge what works.** Non-partisan does not mean relentlessly negative. Where government institutions function well — the Auditor-General's independence, the Western Cape's clean audits, specific municipalities with strong financial management — acknowledge it. Credibility depends on fairness, and fairness requires recognising success alongside failure.

**Be honest about system design vs. implementation failure.** South Africa's constitutional architecture is genuinely ambitious and well-designed. Many of its failures are implementation failures, not design failures. Distinguish clearly between the two. This distinction matters because it affects what citizens should advocate for: fixing the system vs. making the existing system work as intended.
