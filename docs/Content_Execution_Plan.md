## 1. Purpose & Scope

This document is the operational playbook for producing all 15 articles in the Compass series. It synthesises three source documents into a single execution reference: the [Article Series Plan](Compass_article_series.md) (15 article titles with detailed generation prompts), the [Content Style Guide](Compass_Content_Style_Guide.md) (editorial standards, voice, structure, and pre-publication checklist), and the [Autonomous Operations Instruction Set](Compass_Autonomous_Operations.md) (7-agent pipeline, skills, MCPs, approval gates, and 14-day production cycle). The audience for this document is the seven autonomous agents (A1–A7) executing the content pipeline and the human approver (Tshepo Machele) who reviews at every approval gate.

## 2. Article Execution Template

This reusable 6-phase template governs production of any single article in the series. Each phase maps to the autonomous operations agents and references the style guide constraints. The full cycle targets 14 days per article.

| Phase | Days | Agent(s) | Key Actions | Style Guide Constraints | Approval Gate? |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|------------------------|----------------|
| **1. Research** | 1–3 | A1 (Content Strategist) | Compile sources from AGSA, National Treasury, DPME, StatsSA, and academic journals (Politikon, JOSAS, Transformation, Development Southern Africa). Identify 2–3 expert contacts for anecdotes (from DPME, SAMEA, Twende Mbele, PARI, HSRC, or SA universities). **Verify every proposed expert is a real person with published research in the relevant field** — confirm via Google Scholar, institutional pages, ORCID, or academic databases (minimum two independent sources). Verify all source URLs are live and current. Draft research brief with primary sources, data points, expert contacts, and **expert verification evidence** (links to Google Scholar profiles, institutional bios, or key publications). | Every claim must be anchored in data (§5.3). Use most recent available data; state the year explicitly (§5.3). Sources must be from high-credibility institutions. **Every named expert must be verified before inclusion in the research brief — zero tolerance for unverified or fabricated experts** (§5.1). | **Yes** — Tshepo approves research brief (SLA: 24 hours) |
| **2. Drafting** | 4–8 | A2 (Content Author) | Generate article from approved research brief + article generation prompt. Produce valid YAML frontmatter (title, subtitle, part, articleNumber, sphere, description 150–160 chars, publishDate, readingTime, status, series.prev, series.next, seo.keywords). Write in O'Reilly conversational register with BLUF opening, flowing prose (no bullet points), 2–3 named expert anecdotes, and Practical Toolkit ending. Minimum 5,000 words. Calculate reading time (word count / 200 wpm). Generate SEO meta description (150–160 chars) and title (<60 chars). | Direct address with "you" throughout (§4.2). Lead with specifics (§4.2). BLUF in first 1–2 paragraphs (§5.1). No bullet points in prose (§5.1). No hype words (§7.1). Non-partisan tone (§12). British English spelling (§6.1). Oxford comma (§6.1). Define technical terms on first use (§5.2). | **Yes** — Tshepo approves draft (SLA: 72 hours) |
| **3. Editorial QA** | 9–10 | A3 (Editorial Quality Agent) | Run Zod schema validation on frontmatter. Proofread for grammar, spelling, and style. Enforce O'Reilly conversational register — flag academic or corporate tone. Verify BLUF structure, expert anecdotes (2–3, named with institutional affiliation), Practical Toolkit section, and Sources section with hyperlinks. **Run expert verification checks: confirm each named expert is a real person at the stated institution with published research in the cited field (Google Scholar, ORCID, institutional pages — minimum two independent sources). Verify that paraphrased insights accurately represent the expert's documented research positions and that specific publications are cited. Flag any expert who cannot be verified for replacement with an institutional source.** Verify Resources section exists with links to verifiable publications and institutional sources. Test all internal and external links. Flag partisan language, hype words, unexplained jargon. Verify heading hierarchy (H2/H3, no H1 in body). Generate structured quality report (pass/fail per criterion, **including expert verification status for each cited expert**). | All pre-publication checklist items (§13) must pass. Zero tolerance for partisan language. **Zero tolerance for unverified or fabricated experts.** All links must be functional. All five brand attributes must hold (Trustworthy, Empowering, Accessible, Serious, Non-partisan). | **Yes** — Tshepo approves quality report (SLA: 24 hours) |
| **4. Revision** | 11–12 | A2 + A3 | Incorporate Tshepo's feedback and A3's quality report findings. Re-validate frontmatter schema. Re-test all links. Re-verify tone, BLUF, anecdotes, and toolkit section. A3 produces updated quality report confirming all issues resolved. | Same constraints as Phases 2 and 3. Content must pass all Zod schema validations before proceeding. | **Yes** — Tshepo approves final version (SLA: 24 hours) |
| **5. Publish** | 13 | A4 (Publishing & Deployment) + A7 (Site Reliability) | A4: Create feature branch (`content/{part}-{article}-{slug}`), commit Markdown to `/src/content/articles/`, open PR with article summary. Verify `npm run build` succeeds. Monitor Netlify deploy preview — verify article renders, sphere tag colour, OG image (1200x630px), prev/next navigation, callout styling. A7: Run post-deploy health checks, Lighthouse audit (Performance >90, Accessibility >95, SEO >95), page weight check (<400KB, target <200KB), verify Pagefind index includes new article. | Page weight target: 200KB, hard limit: 400KB (§11). Heading hierarchy must render correctly. Metadata line must show reading time, sphere tag, and publish date (§8). | **Yes** — Tshepo approves PR merge (SLA: 24 hours) |
| **6. Distribute & Monitor** | 14+ | A5 (Distribution & Growth) + A6 (Analytics & Insights) | A5: Draft notification email (Subject: "[Article Title] — New on Compass"; body: title, subtitle, one-sentence hook, UTM-tagged link; plain text or minimal HTML). Verify WhatsApp share button constructs correct pre-filled message with UTM parameters. Verify OG preview renders correctly in WhatsApp. A6: Track engagement — page views, time on page, scroll depth (25/50/75/100%), WhatsApp shares, email click-throughs, outbound clicks to government data sources. | Email: no images, no complex HTML (§10.4 distribution standards). WhatsApp share text includes article title, one-sentence hook, UTM-tagged URL, Compass sign-off (§10.3). | **Yes** — Tshepo approves notification email send (SLA: 12 hours) |

## 6. Document Maintenance

This document is updated when the publication schedule changes, when a new approval gate is introduced, or when the production cycle timing is adjusted. The three source documents remain the authorities for their respective domains:

- **[Article Series Plan](Compass_article_series.md)** — authoritative for article titles, generation prompts, and series structure
- **[Content Style Guide](Compass_Content_Style_Guide.md)** — authoritative for editorial standards, voice, tone, and pre-publication checklist
- **[Autonomous Operations Instruction Set](Compass_Autonomous_Operations.md)** — authoritative for agent responsibilities, skills, MCPs, and approval gate definitions

In the event of a conflict between this execution plan and any source document, the source document takes precedence.
